These are then cast in a plastic resin (Smooth-Cast 320) which, once set, I then paint by hand in acrylics. \r\n\r\nOnce each sculpture is cast and painted, I spray them with a matte finish and attach them each to their own personalized backgrounds, which are small canvases that I have also painted by hand. While the molding process does make it easier to duplicate these \"Dudes,\" no two pieces are ever exactly alike, and a lot of hard work and love goes into each piece. \r\n\r\nI also feature a few truly one of a kind pieces, sculpted from polymer clay and then hand painted in acrylic paint.

Next thing I knew I was selling them all of the state of Florida.\r\nThese machines are custom built with all new components.  The only used part is the wine or whiskey barrel.  \r\nI have various styles including my traditional Wine Barrel arcade that is 39 inches tall, a Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrel that is 36 inches tall and a Wine Barrel / Bar arcade that has storage inside of the barrel that can be used a bar or for storage.",

The idea came to me because of the game Donkey Kong.  Donkey Kong would throw barrels at Mario to stop him from saving the princess.\r\nThis started out about a year ago when I made one for myself and then for my neighbors, friends and family.  Suddenly, Barrel of Kong was created and I have been building this in my free time and on weekends in my garage and selling them to individuals all over the state of Florida.\r\nThey have been a huge hit and I am getting referrals from past customers.",

Not just the Internet experience, Facebook and Twitter - but all the behind-the-scenes \"stuff\" that makes it all work.  Not only is engineering challenging and exciting work - but the career rewards and compensation is outstanding!\r\n\r\nTo start off, the student should be introduced to a wide variety of career choices and options. the Maker Faire is one of the best examples I can think of.\r\n\r\nToday, for this Maker Faire  demonstration, I would like to open the door for the student to get an introduction to Ham Radio and the Short Wave Listener experience. All the \"stuff\" that is consumer electronics, Cell phones, and household appliances - all start with the basics of electricity.   Ham radio and Short Wave radio listening is something that is age appropriate and great way to get hands-on electronics experience.\r\n\r\nMy name is Ken Vanslette, callsign W1HV, and I love Ham radio!!!",

He helped in some small part with designing Printed Circuit Boards, Solar panels, pumps and valves used in the three main engines of Space Shuttle.  later employed by General Dynamics, he worked on production of US Army Camouflage nets, followed by US military Chemical and Biological Warfare  equipment.

I've built remote-controlled lawnmowers and a spot welder out of parts from an old microwave, so this seemed like the natural next step. I want to design things that the public can see and...well...see how they do. It will be great to see how others build things to meet the needs of others. That's the real reason behind joining the Maker Faire group. I enjoy what I do and want to join others who think the way that I do.",

We carry soaps, bath salts, body lotion, lip balms, candles, incense, lip balms, etc..\r\nOne of our best sellers though are our cherry pit packs. Microwaveable cherry pit packs are filled with dried cherry stones that are reclaimed from a cannery located in Michigan. Cherry pits make a superior filler for natural heat pads because they are not subject to rancidity and pantry pests that can infest other fillers such as rice, corn, flax and barley. When heated in the microwave for two minutes they produce a moist relaxing heat that's perfect for relieving aches and pains.  These packs are reusable and last for many years.  They also conform to the natural contours of the users body in a way that ordinary heating pads just can't beat.",

The artwork is created by photographing a silicon computer chip using a microscope and special lighting. Silicon is a silvery gray element and not very exciting to look at. The colors in ChipScapes come from a process I use that creates a prism effect derived from special lighting that takes advantage of the layered manufacturing process of computer chips. I use different lighting, angles, and the prism effect of chips to create colorful images of an otherwise boring gray chip. I use mostly vintage microprocessor and memory chips from the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the artwork and the chip, I also include stories about the history and importance of the chips. I use shadow box frames , canvas, and jewelry frames. My artworks are in museums around the world.",

It's a digital art form based on computer chips. \r\n\r\nI've worked with computer systems for over 40 years, so chip technology is something I'm familiar with, but I'm by no means an expert. ChipScapes came about as a confluence of hobbies. I am a collector of vintage computer chips, and I am an avid photographer. I had a challenge communicating my fascination with chips with my family and friends. These funny bug-like devices couldn't tell their own stories :)  I began taking pictures of these microscopic chips, framing the chips with their photographs, and writing stories about them. I found art to be the communication vehicle I needed. To me, the sharing of stories, the art, and the beauty is what ChipScapes are all about. It is about preserving these chips, which today are being ground up and melted for their precious metals. I love the creation stories, the marketing challenges, and the corporate intrigue that swirled around them. \r\n\r\nI am grateful for the support I have received and the opportunities that I have been given. I could never have guessed where my artworks would find homes. However, I currently have patrons in over 20 countries, world-class companies have commissioned pieces, and very prestigious museums have collected my artwork. \r\n\r\nWe can live our lives ignoring the beauty all around us and just see gray, but I choose to seek out beauty and share it with others. I hope to inspire people to find the art in all that they do. After all, even in the coldness of technology, we can find beauty, if we just look for it.",

The demonstrations will get you acquainted with the concepts and applications of photonics, from topics as simple as the reflection and refraction of light (Schilieren imaging), to technologies as complicated as optical communication (Laser music player) and non-conventional imaging systems (Hologram, Laser speckle constrast imaging and other \"exotic photography\"). Within our college, we host annual Optics Demonstration Design competitions where we ask photonics-major students to design and build setups that demonstrate the concepts and applications of optics. They have been used on CREOL’s Optics Day, STEM day,  MakeFest (Orlando Science Center) and other outreach events.\r\nAn itemized list includes (tentitave)\r\n1. Seeing the heat: a Schlieren imaging device that visualizes the airflow, such as turbulance and the hot air around your palm;\r\n2. Laser music player: free-space optical communication without cables (Eye safe);\r\n3. Soy-sauce optics: self-focusing of beam (a non-linear optics effect that is a hot research topic) in soy sauce and other everyday materials;\r\n4. Michelson interferometer: see the fringes from tiny irregularity (roughness) of a seemingly flat optical surface;\r\n5. Hologram projector: converting a classroom projector into displaying 3D holograms.\r\nWe will also accompany each setup with a written description and material list so that guests can learn how to build them on their own.\r\nThese student-made optics demonstrations can be unique and, most likely, complimentary to the existing makers’ projects. We hope to expose the visitors to the area of photonics engineering, and help develop their interest in this highly cross-disciplinary STEM field.",

It is also vegan-friendly because we don't use any colorants that contain animal ingredients (such as carmine). If you're looking for something cool and different, we specialize in thermochromic nail polish, which features a specially blended formula that changes colors with temperature. Our polish comes in over 150 different shades and finishes, each one hand-mixed and bottled by us. We only use the highest quality ingredients, including oxides, micas, and solvent-resistant glitter.

The iterated code is processed by a computer application known as a fractal plotter which translates the formulas into complex graphs. Since computers have no understanding of aesthetics, an artist drives the entire process by manipulating the graphs and applying artistic theory.  Fractal mathematics is very closely related to the study of Chaos and fractal geometry is manifested throughout the natural world. Fractal art is recursive by nature and is themed by shapes or patterns that are repeated at different dimensions.  A unique attribute of fractal art is that it contains infinite detail, therefore any section of the graph (no matter how small) can be magnified and rendered at high resolution to any size without losing detail.\r\n\r\nJoseph Presley has been working with fractal art for over 20yrs and will be exhibiting some of his recent still works in the form of limited edition fine art prints that are ready for matting and framing as well as finished masterworks such as gallery wrapped canvas prints embellished with clear acrylics and hi-res prints on metal.  This display will also include original fractal animations for viewing as well as information and demonstrations regarding the tools and creation of this type of art.  \r\n\r\nJoseph is also involved with coordinating the International Fractal Art Symposiums.  The next iteration will be held in Florida and he is excited share information about this upcoming event.  The last conference was held in Spain where there were fractal artists from over 16 countries participated.  The meeting that will be held in Sarasota during 2021 will include an academic track for fractal artists world wide as well as a public track and a public education track connecting the city and local schools with the event, building awareness and understanding of this beautifully complex art from.",

The two bring their unique style and outlook that vintage should be affordable, worn and loved.\r\nKristin has been designing and making buttons since 2002. Her attention to quality and speed is why customers return for her expertise. If you own a band or event button it just may have passed through Kristin’s hands.\r\nKick Bright Shop also carries a large selection of pop-culture related items like collectible toys, glasses, records and record players. Anything cool we probably have it!\r\nIn August 2015 they opened their first physical store in Artegon Marketplace in Orlando, Florida (pictured above). In less than a year the store was successful enough to double in size. In January 2017 Artegon abruptly closed despite the success of the individually owned small businesses operating there leaving Kick Bright without a permanent home.\r\nJeffrey and Kristin are looking to the future, whether it be a permanent new location or traveling pop-ups.

This can be done to window glass and framed to create beautiful pictures. Fusing is the process of kiln firing glass so that the pieces melt together to form the shape, which can then be slumped into a mold to shape it.\r\nWe love to teach structured classes at the Oviedo Mall and also offer private instruction to meet your requirements/schedule.\r\nCome take a look at some of our pieces.

The centerpiece of my exhibit will be an accurate, precise, custom-built 3D printer dubbed the \"Messingdrucker I\" that I made completely from precision-machined parts intended to demonstrate the need for an accurate, rigid 3D printer in the industry, along with a small (2 ft by 4 ft) model train display featuring vintage 1950s-era Lionel model trains.  So much innovation has been lost to history that I feel that it is important to \"dig it all up\" and use it for the greater good of the Maker community!",

A sensory channel (sight, sound, feel, and smell) and an intellectual channel that tries to makes sense of how we feel and put it into context.\r\nWhen your sensory channel is blocked or occupied, your experiences aren’t as intense or vivid. In other words, when you’re physically occupied with something (squeezing the stress ball) your mind isn’t focused or concentrated on whatever is stressing you out.

We host an all night event - 8pm to 8am, called the GMS Lockin.  At the lockin, we have 150+ 8th graders working on varying science topics all night long.  No one sleeps.  All science, all night.  To prepare for this event, we use the idea that we have to do things bigger and better than is done in a normal classroom.  In addition to the guest speakers, unlimited motivating food, and impressive demos around every corner, we have built several life-size games and such to capture their full attention.  We wish to share with you some of the ideas that we have come up with and a few of the builds that we created.  We have a giant, dragon themed smoke ringer and life-sized Guess Who (currently teaching classification, but can be modified to fit any topic),  Giant Kerplunk, an electronic Plinko board, and Candyland (drilling them on the concept of weathering and erosion).\r\nGalaxy Middle also has started a STEM Academy.  Through this academy, our students are being exposed to STEM activities which a regular education system is unable to provide.  Two days a week, we have our 300+ students engaged in 46 different \"labs\" where they get a glimpse of what possible career paths are open for them to take.  There are several engineering labs - designing sensory toys or gadgets for the disabled, modeling prosthetics for animals, experimenting with recipes for bioplastics, designing and testing launch thrust structures.  Our STEM students are encouraged to think outside of the box and \"make\" using a variety of materials.",

Inventure is a creative adventure game in which you compete with your friends to make the most creative and outlandish inventions, characters, and places. Buy materials, bring your creativity to life, and convince your friends to choose your creations as their favorites. Every time you play Inventure, you have the chance to recreate the world of Inventure all your own. Who will you be? What inventions will you create? People, animals, and creatures of your imagination all call Inventure home. So come along, meet new friends, create new places, and solve challenges.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the sneak peek area, you can explore the in-development Myra Makes app, play some of our prototype card games, and join a read-aloud of our latest in-development story book.

Students, math lovers, and artists throughout Central Florida are invited to create individual fractal triangles which will then be collected and assembled to create a large Sierpinski Triangle.   OMC would like to collect enough triangles for the 7th iteration of the Sierpinski Triangle, made out of 2,187 individual triangles at the end of the Maker Faire. It will be like a  mathematical community quilt. The link below shows the construction of a similar fractal triangle in Albuquerque, NM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BabkJYmBCA",

The team is made up of a diverse group of students that are challenged each year to design and build a robot in six weeks that can compete in an international competition. Mentors help guide the students through the engineering design process in order to help the students with the design and fabrication of the robot. The team strives to inspire young people to be leaders by engaging them in exciting hands-on programs that build STEM expertise and encourage innovation. This is accomplished by teaching students that learning in fields traditionally perceived as \"difficult\" can be fun in the right environment. The students also work towards raising awareness and excitement in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) with local and national outreach efforts so that others may have similar opportunities.  This outreach fosters the acquisition of well-rounded life skills including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.",

The challenge, which is a space derby, offers $5.5 million in prizes for teams and will provide launch services on the 2020 NASA SLS-EM1 mission.\r\n\r\nTeam Miles is the only non-university team to have placed and earned prizes in all four rounds of competition, leading up to them being selected as one of the free launch slots. As a team of citizen scientists and engineers, they came together initially through Tampa Hackerspace, a community, non-profit workshop in Tampa, FL. The team expanded with experts in radiation, communications, software development, and project management.\r\n\r\nThe NASA Cube Quest Challenge is a competition to build space-ready, small satellites capable of advanced communication and propulsion near and beyond the moon. Teams strive for high-speed data communications, navigation, and survival in lunar orbit or deep space, competing for an unprecedented $5.5 million prize purse in NASA’s first ever in-space challenge. Cube Quest is part of NASA’s Centennial Challenges Program which accelerates technology by engaging non-traditional sources in competition.\r\n\r\nThe Miles spacecraft is a 6U satellite, about the size of a breadbox, that will be capable of navigating to the Moon, establishing Lunar orbit, conducting its mission, and then navigating to a final orbit near Mars. The entire mission will be flown autonomously by a sophisticated onboard computer system and powered by evolutionary plasma thrusters.\r\n\r\nThe team’s efforts have also been supported by strategic partnerships with Fluid and Reason (http://fluidandreason.com/), Yosemite Space (http://yosemitespace.com/), The DRI (http://thedri.com/), Piedmont Precision Aeroculture (http://ppaeroculture.com/), Brainloop (http://www.brainloop.com/), Basecamp (https://basecamp.com/), Thermal Management Technologies (http://tmtsdl.com/), and Sabalcore (http://www.sabalcore.com/)",

According to the rules of Odyssey of the Mind, adults may not offer \"outside assistance\", which includes offering ideas about what materials to use, or how to build. \r\nOrion built the original design using legos with motors. The boys then built models out of balsa wood, which they then scaled up and built out of wood. They overcame many challenges during the build, figuring out how to make it have a walking motion, discovering the limits imposed by weight, etc. They were also required to break down the alpaca into two separate suitcases, and they came up with an ingenious chain-tensioning sytem to make that happen. \r\nThe alpaca was not able to walk, due to the limitations of the motor that they used (another learning moment!), so they mounted it on wheels for practical motion, allowing the legs to \"walk\" now that there was no longer weight on them.\r\nThis would be an amazing exhibit for young makers to see. It is truly impressive to see what two kids were able to build with enough hard work (over 100 hours) and determination!",

Small handwoven fabric pieces also have touch sensors woven in, with either conductive thread or handspun conductive yarn for the sensor area.  The Cat Cube has a conductive ear on the cat face, and conductive crocheted blocks on each side, again using an Adafruit Circuit Playground Express.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit will feature people spinning yarn, demonstrating weaving on different types of looms, and a free take-away (or do it now) weaving activity.",
