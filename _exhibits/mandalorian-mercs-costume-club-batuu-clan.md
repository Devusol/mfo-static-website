    description: "The Mandalorian Mercs Costume Club is an international STAR WARS™ costuming organization dedicated to celebrating the STAR WARS™ universe through the creation, display, and wearing of quality character costumes that represent the Mandalorian characters and culture from the STAR WARS™ sagas.

The MMCC unites individuals with a common love for STAR WARS™ and the Mandalorian culture/characters while encouraging self-improvement, personal growth, family involvement, and fellowship with peers.

The MMCC promotes interest in STAR WARS™ and facilitates the use of these costumes for STAR WARS™-related events as well as contributing to the local community through costumed charity and volunteer work.

MMCC is unique as it encourages is membership to embrace creativity and individualism as opposed to costume organization based on visual accuracy from the STAR WARS™ films and canon reference material. The MMCC is an inclusive and friendly club, following the Mandalorian way of “Clans” or family units and a clans’ ability to adopt anyone who wishes to be a Mandalorian.

Recognized by Lucasfilm LTD. as “The Elite Mandalorian Costuming Organization”; Mandalorian Mercs Costuming Club set the standards of Mandalorian costuming based on canon film(Boba and Jango Fett), Expanded Universe, “Legends”, action figure, and video/board game references. Our CRLs (Costume Requirement List) allow official members to be highly creative with their Mandalorian costumes, even though there is a minimum visual and quality standard that must be reached; every Mandalorian Mercs Costume Club member is constantly encouraged to improve their costume to elite standards.

The Mandalorian Mercs Costume Club lives up to it’s label as “The Elite Mandalorian Costuming Organization” by promoting the love of STAR WARS™, creation of quality costumes, and spirit of volunteerism.
