    description: "Low-Tek is a primarily father and son combat robotics team from Charleston, SC. Initially discovering the hobby and competing with a heavyweight in the early 2000s, the interest was rekindled when insect-class bots were discovered in recent years. A beetleweight was built under the new team name, referencing the 'lo-tech' approach with no CAD or fancy machine shop tools being used in the construction."
