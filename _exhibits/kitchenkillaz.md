excerpt: "KitchenKillaz is a touring acoustic duo crashing kitchens around the country.  Comprised of Billy Floyd, Jay \"the Commodore\" Stephens and The Mad Scientist, Dennis Cutter."
description: "The KitchenKillaz is an entertaining blend of Music, Culinary Arts, Community, and Interaction. Their show is a unique concept as they crash (play) a different kitchen every Friday night, in an audience member's home while streaming it live on Facebook at 9:05 pm. During the show, they play a mixture of creative and catchy originals and well-known covers, treating their audience to a very cool experience. 


On occasion, the host will provide the menu for the evening. Sometimes catered, cooked, or ordered, the food, kitchen, and recipe are talked about and shared with the live audience. If the host wants to enjoy the evening, relax, and entertain their guests, they can leave the cooking to The Mad Scientist. Dennis Cutter is a traveling chef that tours with the duo serving up delicious entrees for the viewers to experience and the guests to enjoy. At 7:05 pm, each Monday and Wednesday, they play a shorter version of the show with their Monday show including a weekly wrap-up and a Wednesday show including songs voted on by the community.



 Billy Floyd has been writing music for over 20 years and brings brilliant energy to songwriting paired perfectly with The Commodore (Jay Stephens) his amazing harmonies and creating the perfect guitar lines.  The KitchenKillaz are broadcast on IndieSceneMusicRadio every Sunday. They receive press coverage, national and international radio airplay, and have been featured on various podcasts, radio stations and TV shows such as A Corporate Time with Tom &amp; Dan, DropKick Radio, Belter Radio UK, Tampa Bay's Morning Blend and local events such as United We Brunch, Big Green Egg Fest, SYFY Bartow, Beatles on the Beach."
