excerpt: "Nerdy suncatchers, hand painted on acrylic. They look like stained glass, but they are lightweight and shatter resistant. There will be finished pieces for sale, as well as sample pieces showing the various stages of creation."
description: "My creations use a line of products that are made to mimic stained glass. Many people use it on glass, but I chose to work on acrylic. Acrylic is less than half the weight of glass, and much more durable. I get a lot of questions about how I make my pieces. I don’t always use products as instructed, and I also make some of my own blends with different paints and additives. I have shown short video clips on instagram, but now I’m looking forward to having the opportunity to give people an idea of how the process actually looks, in person."
