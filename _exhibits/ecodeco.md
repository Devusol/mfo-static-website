description: "The exhibit will showcase various examples of using recycled containers for set and forget hydroponics."
description-long: "The exhibit will show how various containers, i.e. milk jugs, food delivery trays, storage boxes, can be used as growth containers for set and forget hydroponics. Additionally some containers are decoupaged with recycled materials as a means to add an artistic touch to a patio setting. The intent is to show how anyone, regardless of whether one lives in a house or an apartment, can grow their own food."

  description: "I am a retired science teacher and former research biologist. In my retirement, I have explored a number of interests, gardening being one of them. In 2013, I became a master gardener for Seminole county. I have been involved in a variety of projects and one of my favorites is \"set and forget\" hydroponics. With this interest and my passion for promoting recycling, I have put a different spin on the method in an attempt to make it visually appealing and practical for anyone to grow their own food. "
