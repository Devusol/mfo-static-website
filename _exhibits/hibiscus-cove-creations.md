excerpt: "I create hand- bound journals with hand dyed dyed pages and custom covers, altered (decorated) bottles in a wide variety of themes, clay creations such as dragons, birds, and bowls. I also create and assortment of small jewelry is: earrings and bracelets."
description: "I create journals by first hand dying each page, creating a variety of colors and patterns, and in some cases Scents. I then bind them into books using a variety of methods, some sewn or tied, many Perfect bound (glued like a text book). Once the books are created, I make the cover art using mixed media: paper, inks, pants, feathers, clay art, and other things to form unique and beautiful books.

I also create altered bottles (decorated bottles). I paint, decoupage, bake, dye, stain, age/antique the bottles to get the effect I want, and then add a wide variety of objects and media to decorate then. I include themes from steampunk to fairy houses, skulls to beaches.

I have a small assortment of clay-work and character pieces including dragons, birds, flowers, and bowls.

My jewelry collection of earrings and bracelets is small but each piece is handmade using glass, stone, metal, and hand worked leather"
