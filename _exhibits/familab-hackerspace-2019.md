excerpt: "FamiLAB’s mission is to be a community that fosters learning and creativity through hands-on projects, collaboration, and the sharing of skills &amp; tools to improve ourselves and enrich the world around us. A few of our members have been working on some amazing projects including building our new space. Check out our booth to see what we've been making!"
description: "Are you Curious?  Are you creative?  Do you like working with your hands - or do you think you would if you had the chance?  FamiLAB is a makerspace - a place where you can use shared tools and work areas to make cool stuff.

FamiLAB is also a community - a place where like minded people will help you with your project and share your excitement about your ideas.  We have tools for metal and woodworking, leather working, welding, laser cutting and 3D printing.  Or, for your softer (or software) side, we have electronics, software hacking, cosplay, leather work, multimedia night, and even a darkroom!  If your soft side is really squishy, check out the biohacking lab.   

Sound cool?  Wait 'till you see it in person!  Stop by our booth and talk to some of our members, or come out to the lab - we have an open house the first Tuesday of every month.  See what's happening by checking out our website, familab.org, or follow familab on social media by using the links below.

Familab will feature our Makeathon game, Paddle War Domination!  Come try your hand at a mechanical Pong-type game."
