description: "Learn how a Minecraft server uses familiar maker techniques recreating beloved theme parks virtually"
description-long: "For almost 10 years, MCParks has been dedicated to faithfully recreating theme parks such as Walt Disney World, Universal Orlando, Disneyland, and more in Minecraft at a 1:1 scale. 
Along the way, we&#039;ve learned a variety of techniques 

Our volunteer Cast Members use their curiosity and creativity across several fields:
Imagineers: Use satellite imagery, videos, photos, blueprints, and a healthy dose of trigonometry to accurately design and build structures and landscaping 
Technicians: Implement all the effects that make rides, shows, and attractions function, ensuring everyone&#039;s favorite ride details are preserved
3D Model artists: Develop models of ride vehicles and merchandise items found in our parks
Pixel artists: Create art assets that feel like they belong in Minecraft used in signage, decor, character costumes, merchandise items, and more
Software Developers: Create the tools used by all of the above departments to do their work, and develop MMO-like features to game-ify the guest experience

Our exhibit will showcase some of the techniques and processes of each of these departments -- maybe we&#039;ll convince you to join our ranks of passionate theme park fans!"
