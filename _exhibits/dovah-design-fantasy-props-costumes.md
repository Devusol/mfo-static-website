    description: "I am a prop and costume artist based in sunny Central Florida, USA. Cosplaying and prop making have been my hobbies since 2014, when I was inspired to start by famous prop artists and my favorite video game, Skyrim. There is something incredibly satisfying about bringing fantasy props and costumes into the real world, especially a badass weapon or set of armor."
