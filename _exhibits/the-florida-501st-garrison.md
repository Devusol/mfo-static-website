excerpt: "The Florida 501st Garrison is the Florida chapter of The 501st Legion, a world wide Star Wars costuming organization. Our members come from all walks of life and from all across the state with one common trait, The Empire!"
description: "Are you a fan of the Empire? Do you have an interest in building your own Storm Trooper armor or any of our many other characters that you can find on the \"bad guys\" wall at your local cantina? Look no further because you have found the organization that caters to the research, construction, and wearing of costumes featured from all 7 (soon to be 8) Star Wars films. The 501st legion is primarily where you will find Darth Vader, Storm Troopers, Scout Troopers, Snow Troopers, Sith Lords, Dark Jedi,  and even Jawas!


The 501st legion prides itself on \"Bad Guys Doing Good\", across the entire legion in 2015 over 62,000 volunteer hours were logged and donations made in Honor of the 501st legion was reported at $587,000. Not bad for doing something we in the legion consider a hobby. 

If you're interested in learning what it takes to join the 501st Legion and your local squad please stop by and check out our booth."
