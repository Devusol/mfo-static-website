  description: "I have been involved in the Maker Movement since 2012. Mad engineer*, junkbot enthusiast, and DIY hobbyist across multiple interests.

As a jack-of-some-trades, most of my projects are rough around the edges and many last long enough to demo a spectacle before falling apart at the seams.

I’m on Thingiverse with some rookie and goofy 3d models, I have been homepage’d a couple times on Instructables for MaKey MaKey projects, and I made my own Stranger Things cardboard LED wall with a RaspberryPi and Python.

I recently built my own website at MachineLearningArt.com where I want to sell art books, curate AI art resources for others, and eventually make it so that others can sell their own AI art.

Join me at this booth as I fuddle my way through using AI art generators, and let’s see what we can figure out together!

*I have no control groups, so I cannot claim mad scientist."
