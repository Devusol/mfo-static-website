permalink: /exhibits/halo-hit-n-spin/
exhibit-id: 22R-28
exhibit-zone: "Robot Ruckus (Spirit Building)"
space-number: Unassigned
description: "Halo is a 3lb, and Hit &#039;N Spin is a 1lb meltybrain robot."
description-long: "Halo is back for its fifth event. We&#039;ve made a number of mechanical improvements, including custom hub motor wheels and shatter-proof TPU enclosures. This time it wont explode for sure!

Hit &#039;N Spin is back for its third event, sporting a new TPU enclosure. A new traction control algorithm should reduce the traction issues seen last year.

And both robots are sporting a new custom-designed magnetometer sensor. This serves as an all-in-one heading sensor that should prove more reliable than any meltybrain fielded before."
