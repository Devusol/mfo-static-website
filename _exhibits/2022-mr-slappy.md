description-long: "Mr. Slappy was inspired by a late-night YouTube foray into the world of Russian Slap fighting where grown men stand there and slap each other across the face until someone gives up or falls down.  While our version is nowhere as large or imposing as that, Mr. Slappy will never back down from a fight and is also always willing to give a friendly wave or high-five to the fans between matches."
