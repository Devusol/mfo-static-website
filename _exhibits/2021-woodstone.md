  description: "I create scarves by Arm Knitting out of Indian Silk Saris that have been ripped into ribbons.  They are very light, soft and colorful. 
I also Finger Knit a Couch Cuddle from fat soft chenille yarn.  It is a perfect size to snuggle under while you are on the couch or in your favorite chair.
I have taught these skills to others so I am willing and experienced in demonstrating both the Arm and Finger Knitting process."
