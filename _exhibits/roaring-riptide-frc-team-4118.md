excerpt: "At this exhibit FRC Team 4118 Roaring Riptide will be demoing their robot from the past year, explaining some of their assistive technology solutions, and spreading awareness of FIRST in order to help bring STEM education to everyone. If you enjoy STEM and seeing how students are building the future, come see what Roaring Riptide is all about!"
description: "Roaring Riptide's exhibit is all about bringing accessibility to everyone. Whether it be in the form of resources to learn more about STEM or assistive technology for people with disabilities, Roaring Riptide's goal is to help build the community through STEM. At this exhibit, you will be able to find more information about all levels of FIRST and why you would want to get involved in a local team or about how to get in touch with teams and makers if you need help with a project. Roaring Riptide has been building robots to compete in the FRC competition (an annual event) since 2011. In 2016 Roaring Riptide launched outreach projects in assistive technology. Roaring Riptide has now partnered with ATMakers, Makers Making Change, and Magic Wheelchair. If you want to see how young makers can help solve problems faced by society today, come by!"

    description: "Roaring Riptide: FIRST Robotics Competition Team #4118, was founded in 2011 at P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School in Gainesville, Florida. The team is made up of a diverse group of students that are challenged each year to design and build a robot in six weeks that can compete in an international competition. Mentors help guide the students through the engineering design process in order to help the students with the design and fabrication of the robot. The team strives to inspire young people to be leaders by engaging them in exciting hands-on programs that build STEM expertise and encourage innovation. This is accomplished by teaching students that learning in fields traditionally perceived as \"difficult\" can be fun in the right environment. The students also work towards raising awareness and excitement in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) with local and national outreach efforts so that others may have similar opportunities.  This outreach fosters the acquisition of well-rounded life skills including self-confidence, communication, and leadership."
