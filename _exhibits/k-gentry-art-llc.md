Those designs are used by industry professionals as reference to animate the characters.
I have also illustrated for the children’s book, medical, editorial, music, and print industries.  I create and sell limited edition fine art prints, canvases, character design art books, and original sketches."

I am a character illustrator/designer for the animation and game industry.  My passion and my job is to give visual meaning and definition to a written description of any number of characters and creatures.  Those designs are used by industry professionals as reference to animate the characters.
I have also illustrated for the children’s book, medical, editorial, music, and print industries. Although my first love is pencil, I completes my character designs and illustrations on a Mac utilizing Industry standard professional software and a Wacom Cintiq 24HD.
