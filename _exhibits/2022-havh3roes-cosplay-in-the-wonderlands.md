  description: "Award-winning, husband-and-wife duo HavH3roes? Cosplay creates semi-to-fully handmade costumes and props. Although collectively cosplaying since 2013, we have been cosplaying and competing at conventions since 2019. We specialize in stylized/painted cosplays (from head to toe) and look to upcycle materials as much as possible. Our mediums span the realms of sewing, 3D modeling/printing, foamsmithing and everything in-between. We are constantly looking for new challenges and skills to push our boundaries and imaginations!"
