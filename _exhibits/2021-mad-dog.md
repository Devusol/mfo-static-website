description: "Mad Dog is a 250lb robot designed to fight using its \"swerve\" drivetrain and pneumatic flipper!"
description-long: "Mad Dog drives around using a \"swerve drive\". These drive modules work by allowing us to rotate the wheel AND rotate the orientation of the wheel at the same time (think about a powered shopping cart wheel). With multiple of these modules in tandem, we can strafe around the competition without sacrificing any drive power!

For its weapon, it utilizes a pneumatic piston inside of the robot to flip robots in front of it. There are multiple air storage tanks located inside of Mad Dog that give it the air necessary to use the weapon during the match."
