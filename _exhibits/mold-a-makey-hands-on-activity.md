excerpt: "Injection molding activity! Make a Makey!"
description: "During your visit, you will have the opportunity to make a plastic molded Makey Robot.  This workshop will show you the steps required to make a Makey using a plastic molding process.  This opportunity will have a small cost associated to cover the cost of the material along with helping to support  Gra-V Robotics.  We are a high school robotics team that functions in Orange County and the money raised will help cover the cost of registration, travel, and parts/materials."
