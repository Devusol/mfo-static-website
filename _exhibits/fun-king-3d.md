excerpt: "3D Printing related items including objects that we printed as well as the printers. We will be displaying the FK-1 for the first time in public!! The FK-1 is a 1200x400x475mm home designed and built 3D Printer! Come see this monster!"
description: "We will have a variety of items that we have 3D Printed. We will also have a couple of printers on display. The FK-1 will be the center piece of our display this year and it is the first time it will be seen in public. This project was over 8 months in the making and it is a sight to see. With a build capacity of 1200x400x475mm it has the potential to build some amazing things."
