excerpt: "Daleks and how to build them. There are lots of build techniques to building one and lots of things you have to think about before building."
description: "Do you want to build a Dalek?  Or want to know what goes into building one? We will have our British War Dalek that is made of cardboard on display. Some parts &amp; pieces from mid-build fully functional Daleks, build manuals, and other Dalek related materials. We are hoping to be working on the cardboard Dalek during MakerFaire doing some upgrades. We are more than happy to discuss with anyone about the building materials and techniques used to build a Dalek. Build topics can include types of construction materials, electronics, and painting. Building a Dalek takes all types of creative outlets."

    description: "We are Florida geeks that love Doctor Who and the villainous Daleks, that is why we built them. We love building them and sharing them with other enthusiasts. We will talk up storm about our builds and sharing tips and procedures for the builds. We are always looking to add to our Florida Brigade Skaro Army."
