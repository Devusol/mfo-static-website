  description: "I'm a stained glass and fused glass artist, focusing primarily on geek culture.  My work can be found online or at sci-fi and comic cons in the southeast.  I work in both copper foil and lead came methods of stained glass construction, and often incorporate fused glass elements or painted elements fired in the kiln."
