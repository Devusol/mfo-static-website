  description: "Central Florida Vocal Arts is a non-profit music advocacy organization, dedicated to providing the highest quality training to young artists, while also providing performance opportunities to currently emerging artists of all ages. We are creating a continuing life cycle for the vocal arts in Central Florida through a three step model. The first step, Education and Training introduces young artists to the arts. Through our educational initiatives, we develop studentsâ€™ talent, passion and confidence. Our Mainstage Productions provide a transition period for students, ages 8-18, to emerge on stage alongside local, professional talent. Our life cycle culminates with Opera del Sol, offering innovative productions in unexpected places, challenging perceptions of who the operatic performer and audience member are and what defines the genre as a whole."
