description-long: "We're showcasing a 2 spool high-pass turbine jet engine with over 80 3d printed parts. 
As well as a 4 cylinder / 4 piston Subaru Boxer Engine, which is about 35% the size of the original engine. This is a fully working and timed model. The top can be removed to see the inner workings of the entire engine. It is powered by a small electric DC motor."
