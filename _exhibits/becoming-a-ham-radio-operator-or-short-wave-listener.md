description-long: "It is never too early for students to start looking for a career choice well before graduating from High School.  The choices are endless, but some offer opportunities that few could hope to experience.  A professional career in business entrepreneurship or technical fields is a choice few would consider, but offers an exciting life experience.

The field of electronics is wide ranging.  Not just the Internet experience, Facebook and Twitter - but all the behind-the-scenes \"stuff\" that makes it all work.  Not only is engineering challenging and exciting work - but the career rewards and compensation is outstanding!

To start off, the student should be introduced to a wide variety of career choices and options. the Maker Faire is one of the best examples I can think of.

Today, for this Maker Faire  demonstration, I would like to open the door for the student to get an introduction to Ham Radio and the Short Wave Listener experience. All the \"stuff\" that is consumer electronics, Cell phones, and household appliances - all start with the basics of electricity.   Ham radio and Short Wave radio listening is something that is age appropriate and great way to get hands-on electronics experience.

My name is Ken Vanslette, callsign W1HV, and I love Ham radio!!!"

  description: "Ken Vanslette has been a Maker before there was a Maker !  Growing up in Port Clinton, Ohio, a small community on Lake Erie, he was tearing stuff apart by age 4. Things like lawn mower engines and go carts, vacuum tube TVs, large Tesla Coils!  All of this lead to attending Ohio University, in Athens, Ohio, eventually getting a BS Degree in Industrial Engineering.  
Soon after graduation, he decided to move to Florida to be a part of the Space Program. He helped in some small part with designing Printed Circuit Boards, Solar panels, pumps and valves used in the three main engines of Space Shuttle.  later employed by General Dynamics, he worked on production of US Army Camouflage nets, followed by US military Chemical and Biological Warfare  equipment. His passion through out his career has been Ham Radio and digital electronic design - it is what he still does today.  "
