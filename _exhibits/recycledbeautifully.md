description: "Handmade recycled copper wire tree of life pendants "
description-long: "Recycled Beautifully creates elegant jewelry that starts as garbage. Celina Ortiz and her husband find discarded television sets and deconstruct them, removing the copper and aluminum wire in the process. With this valuable material in hand, they wrap the material around stone pendants in a tree-like design. The wire spans the width of the teardrop and oval forms, framing them with delicate branches that electrifyingly extend and wrap around the stone.

Aptly called Tree of Life necklaces, Recycled Beautifully twists and binds the same design over a variety of colors and patterns. Some stones, such as the opal or abalone, have a dazzling, psychedelic feel to them. Other finishes like turquoise or agate are more conventional but equally as stunning, showcasing Earthâ€™s amazing creations with a clever eco-friendly enclosure."

  description: "Recycled Beautifully is proud to say that \"We Recycle\"! All of our hand wrapped jewelry is made using recycled copper or aluminum wire that we pull out of T.V.'s that people throw in the trash. By using recycled wire we are able to not only keep these items out of the landfills but we are also able to keep our jewelry priced at amazingly low prices."
