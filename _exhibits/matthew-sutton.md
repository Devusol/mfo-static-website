description-long: "I am always drawing! Well, almost always drawing. From comics pages to trading cards and commissioned pieces I rarely don't have a drawing tool in my hand. I like it that way. If you'd like to see how to start a sketch from scratch, or how to ink like a pro then all you need to do is come by my table! I've also got an assortment of prints and original artwork featuring some of the most iconic characters in comics and pop culture. I'm looking forward to meeting you!"
