description: "Hoffman Engineering is a youtube channel which dives into the world of 3D printing, 3D scanning, CAD and lots of nerdy projects! Expect to see animatronic Pokemon, 3D printing, and neat cosplay costumes."
description-long: "We run a youtube channel with over 17,800 subscribers, which focuses on digital fabrication (3D printing, 3D Scanning, CAD) and it's use in both functional designs and costuming. With everything from cosplay props, animatronic pokemon, custom bobble heads, we share both our successes, and more importantly failures, with out community for other to learn from!"
