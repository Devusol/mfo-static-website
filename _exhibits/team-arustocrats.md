description-long: "A group of weirdos in Pittsburgh saw people on the internet racing undersized, extremely uncomfortable, and questionably-safe go karts and we said: \"Sounds like a great idea!\". Since 2014, The aRUSTocrats (Aristocrats from the RUST belt) have been building go karts to enter in the Power Racing Series. We've built the Batmobile (2014), the sCOOL Bus (2015), and the RAMbulance (2017-present) and have won both race weekend and season trophies."
