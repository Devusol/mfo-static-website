description: "BackStabber(1lb), Project: Striker!(1lb), and Counter Attack(3lb)."
description-long: "BackStabber is an Antweight crusher bot. The weapon uses an electric linear actuator to power the crusher which slowly pushes a sharp nail into the opponent. The weapon is so powerful that once we bite down on an opponent it is impossible for them to get away until we let go.
BackStabber has accumulated a record of 2-4 at Robot Ruckus over the past two years but we believe this version has the potential to be a serious threat.

Project: Striker! is an Antweight hammer bot. This will be its first ever competition but we expected it to put on some good fights and entertain the crowd with what may just be the most powerful hammer weapon in the Antweight class.

Counter Attack is our newest bot and first ever Beetleweight. It features two long grabbing arms meant to control opponents around the box. More importantly however, we believe we’ve built a durable bot capable of taking on the competition’s heaviest hitters and surviving till the end."
