excerpt: "Orphiens. An invasion of fun for the whole family. Babies from another planet that are in need of adoption on planet earth."
description: "I'm Marcelino Hoyo, sculptor and mold maker with a passion to make something old school that's fun for kids. Orphiens are dolls / puppets in a toy sling, made with flexible rubber heads, arms and legs and a soft fabric body. Orphiens are capable of many fun facial expressions, making them look realistic and are definitely fun attention getters. for me it has been a 20 year project and feel that Makers Faire would be the right venue to introduce the Orohiens to the world. thank you"
