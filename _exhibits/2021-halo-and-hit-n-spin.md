description: "Halo, a 3lb meltybrain spinner, and Hit &#039;N Spin, a 1lb asymmetric bar meltybrain spinner."
description-long: "Halo, our original combat robot, is a meltybrain spinner, which means it can move about while spinning in place thanks to custom control electronics and firmware. It&#039;s intentionally hollow to ensure we deliver the biggest hits. Back for its fourth event, it&#039;s been redesigned from the ground up for improved survivability and control.

Hit &#039;N Spin is a 1lb asymmetric bar meltybrain. Meltybrain control only requires one wheel to work, and this bot doesn&#039;t have weight for two! It first appeared at MFO 2019 as an experimental bot. It gave such a show that it&#039;s back to strike again, now with a tougher enclosure that probably wont explode!"
