Enjoy three original productions featuring outstanding voices, stunning visuals, and musicians from the Orlando Philharmonic Orchestra. It is a season of laughter and heart with The Marriage of Figaro in November, the Florida premiere of All is Calm in December, and The Daughter of the Regiment in March. 

In addition, the Opera on the Town series returns with three original productions throughout the City Beautiful and beyond.  This season brings adventure, activism, and generosity with Amahl and the Night Visitors in December, The Girl of the Golden West in February, and The Very Last Green Thing in May."
