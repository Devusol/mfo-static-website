description: "Barrel of Kong makes classic 80's arcade machines from repurposed wine and whiskey barrels.
There are 60 games included in the arcade machine such as a Frogger, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, Ms Pac Man, Galaga and many more."
description-long: "I have a love of classic 80's arcade games and had an idea about a year ago to create an arcade machine from a repurposed wine barrel.  The idea came from my love for the game Donkey Kong.  Donkey Kong would throw barrels at Mario to stop him from saving the princess.  I made my first one for myself and then friends and family asked me to make more for them.  Next thing I knew I was selling them all of the state of Florida.
These machines are custom built with all new components.  The only used part is the wine or whiskey barrel.  
I have various styles including my traditional Wine Barrel arcade that is 39 inches tall, a Jack Daniels Whiskey Barrel that is 36 inches tall and a Wine Barrel / Bar arcade that has storage inside of the barrel that can be used a bar or for storage."

  description: "My name is Darrin and I have a love for the arcade classics from the 80's.
I came up with a concept of creating arcade machines from re-purposed wine and whiskey barrels.  The idea came to me because of the game Donkey Kong.  Donkey Kong would throw barrels at Mario to stop him from saving the princess.
This started out about a year ago when I made one for myself and then for my neighbors, friends and family.  Suddenly, Barrel of Kong was created and I have been building this in my free time and on weekends in my garage and selling them to individuals all over the state of Florida.
They have been a huge hit and I am getting referrals from past customers."
