Track your progress and compete to visit more exhibits than your friends in a set period of time. Win swag and get a certificate mapping your participation

Are you an exhibitor and would you like to host an IoT Scavenger Quest Station? As an exhibitor all you have to do to host a station is agree is to let us put the station somewhere in your booth accessible to the public  

Also keep an eye out for nodes in other fun locations as well.  We&#039;re hoping that the Scavenger Quest will encourage folks to roam more widely around Maker Faire, and bring them into contact with more exhibitors. "
