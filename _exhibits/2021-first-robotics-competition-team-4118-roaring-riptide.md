  description: "Roaring Riptide: FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 4118, was founded in 2011 at P.K. Yonge DRS in Gainesville, Florida.  Though we’ve had many successes as a team, we’re most proud of our work in Assistive Technology. In 2019, we founded our #FIRSTwithAT program and have gained the support and recognition from 4 local college student organizations, as well as national organizations for our work.  In addition to these partnerships, the students of Roaring Riptide contributed over 4500 hours to promote STEM education, assistive technology outreach, and within the other FIRST program levels."
