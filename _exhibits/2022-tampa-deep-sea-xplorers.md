description: "Makers of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles located in Tampa Florida"
description-long: "Tampa Deep Sea Xplorers INC (TDSX) is a manufacturer of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV). Based in Tampa Florida, we are passionate about underwater exploration and discovery. Our products are designed to enhance data collection in the deep ocean to depths up to 4000 meters. Our intention is to provide deep sea vehicles that are robust enough to reach great depths at a price point that is affordable for individuals and small institutions. 

Our flagship product is named the Barracuda, which is a small man-portable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which can easily reach depths up to 500 meters. At 12 Kg, the Barracuda is light enough to be hand launched from a small vessel or from the shoreline. Although the vehicle has a small footprint, it is strong enough to withstand the pressures encountered at depth. The Barracuda was designed to allow the rapid collection of sub-sea data to support researchers, explorers, and individuals, as well as the objectives of the Seabed 2030 Initiative. 

Our research and design has provided us with some innovative products such as a mobile underwater LiDAR system that is compact enough to be carried by our Barracuda AUV.

The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) participation in the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project desires to synthesize bathymetry data to map all of the world’s ocean floors by the year 2030. TDSX is excited to participate in developing the technologies to accomplish the goals of the Seabed 2030 Initiative. If this challenge is to be realized within the designated time frame, thousands of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles will be required, that are capable of collecting data at a rate that is an order of magnitude greater than what is currently on the market. TDSX’s motto of 'Deeper, Faster, and Cheaper' recognizes that new technologies will be required that far exceed the capabilities of existing systems.

Our current engineering development has progressed to the point that we will be field testing our latest Barracuda design. TDSX is currently in the process of contacting potential partners who would benefit from our technology. TDSX is currently partnered with NOAA. We are seeking partners engaged in deep water exploration operations who will permit TDSX to operate our AUV in parallel with their current technology or to supplement their data collection processes. We intend to test the maximum data collection capability of a single Barracuda AUV which we project to be around 1 – 2 km^2 per day of operation. We also intend to test the swarm capabilities of the Barracuda and the sub-sea LiDAR system. Compared to existing commercially available systems our Barracuda system should prove to be capable of collecting several times more data per day of operation than what is currently available for small low powered AUVs."
