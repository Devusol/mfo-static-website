excerpt: "Hitodama sells original handmade jewelry, buttons, pins, and art."
description: "Hitodama has been selling at fandom events for nearly a decade. Their pins and accessories are original designs, including a line of enamel pins. Their art includes original works in several media, prints, and fanart. They will have a short story or two. They will hopefully be carrying a line of metal wands. The enclosed photo is from Lumi-con 2018."
