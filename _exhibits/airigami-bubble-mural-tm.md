description-long: "Airigami creates very large scale installations out of latex balloons. We have developed a project specifically for Maker Faires that allows us to not only build an incredibly large creation that lends itself well to photos and selfies, but that also allows hundreds of attendees at a faire to participate in its construction.
It’s a creative 2-D installation designed to be built by community members using easy to inflate and biodegradable latex balloons! Designed by the experts at Airigami, this hands-on exhibit engages visitors in a communal project with maximum impact and minimal mess.
Step-by-step video instructions keep a steady flow of participants engaged. It’s the perfect visual demonstration of how many small efforts can create tremendous results. Participants are self-directed with minimal staff support, allowing them to take ownership of the project, and naturally want to be photographed along side the finished work.
S.T.E.A.M. POWERED, MAKER-MINDED, FAMILY-FRIENDLY FUN!

Project and building process can be modified for level of participant ability
Concierge set up and staffing
Bubble murals can be great as a stand-alone piece, but they also create a perfect backdrop for an optional signature sculpture, such as a giant Makey, while the community follows our instructions to build a mural representative of the location where it's built.
Community participants build the mural over a day or two so it can be built entirely by Maker Faire patrons without staff support. Airigami would provide all equipment, materials, design, and instructions. This can be a DIY project, your staff and volunteers would manage the construction, or we can deliver, setup, and provide staff to oversee it. Cost for this mural as a DIY project is $1500. To have Airigami artists on site, we’re looking at $500-$1500/day in addition to the project cost, depending on the level of support needed."
