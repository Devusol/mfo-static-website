description-long: "Welcome to NOV8Youth, a non-profit dedicated to kindling the flame of curiosity in young individuals globally. Through dynamic workshops, interactive projects, and collaborative events, we're committed to spreading the marvels of STEAM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). Our vision is to create a generation of creative thinkers and problem solvers, well-equipped to make a difference both in their local neighborhoods and on a global scale. Join us as we embark on a journey to inspire, educate, and empower, laying the groundwork for a future where innovation knows no bounds.

I wanted to share a quick overview of what we have in store for our exhibit at Maker Faire Orlando. We're all about engaging and inspiring. I'm thinking we will have interactive demos, short educational workshops, impactful visuals showcasing what our mission and vision are in local and global communities, and opportunities for fundraising. Collaboration is key for us, so we're excited about potential partnerships and/or recruiting new volunteers to help spread the word about NOV8Youth! We are a new non-profit organization so we are looking to build that foundation and get people excited about innovation and STEM + working on networking with other like-minded individuals and makers!"
