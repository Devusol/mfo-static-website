description: "A giant LED illuminati pyramid using a daisy-chainable LED control system."
description-long: "Originally this was built for an outdoor camping festival as an art piece. Here not only is there spectacle in how large the piece came out, but several, multi-discipline engineering challenges were overcome to accomplish this exhibit. Elements of wood-working, lots of 3D printing, electrical engineering, PCB design, fiber arts and more were all integrated together in only under as much careful watch as the pyramid itself symbolizes"
