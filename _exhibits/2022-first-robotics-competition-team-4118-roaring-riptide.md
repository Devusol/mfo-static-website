description-long: "Inventor Dean Kamen founded FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) in 1989. FIRST is about inspiring innovation, igniting curiosity, and creating pathways for students in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) fields. Each January, teams from around the world are tasked with a challenge during a Season Kickoff Event. During the build season (following kickoff) teams work through the design process, with the ultimate goal of building a successful competition robot.  In the months of March and April, teams compete at district, regional, and world competitions.

Our team, Roaring Riptide, competed in the quarter-finals at the Orlando Regional Competition in March 2022. We hope to share more about our student-designed and built robot with you in our FIRST Robotics booth demo."

  description: "Roaring Riptide: FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Team 4118, was founded in 2011 at P.K. Yonge DRS in Gainesville, Florida. Our high-school team is part of a K-12, public research school that&#039;s a subset of the College of Education at the University of Florida. Though we’ve had many successes as a team, we’re most proud of our work in Assistive Technology. In February 2020, we founded our #FIRSTwithAT program and have gained the support and recognition from 4 local college student organizations, as well as national organizations for our work. In addition to these partnerships, the students of Roaring Riptide have contributed over 4500 hours to promote STEM education, assistive technology outreach, and within the other FIRST program levels."
