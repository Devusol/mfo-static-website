description-long: "QueensCove Creative exhibits original traditional painted art, art prints, books, and leather creations. I display originally created art that has been commissioned or included in the numerous art books in which I have been published. If available I have officially licensed Topps sketch cards for sale that I have created for the Topps company. These for the most part are licensed by Lucasfilm for Star Wars but I&#039;ve also created for Nickelodeon and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Franchise as well as Netflix&#039;s Stranger Things franchise. My leathercraft displays my love of history and film lore. Most recently I am creating a fully wearable and functional Rider of Rohan armor set inspired by the Lord of the Rings films. "
