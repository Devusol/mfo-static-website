description: "We will be demonstrating how a Canon wide format printer, a Graphtec cutter plotter and a laminator can be used create unconventional parts and products using specialty medias designed for uses outside of usual mainstram applications. As part of our demonstrations we will produce such things as product faceplates, touchpad screens, light diffusion panels, custom gaskets and seals, miniature and large product decals - precisely cut to fit any contour. We will also demonstrate how the associated software can greatly expand the capabilities of the equipment. Technical specialists from Canon USA will accompany us to assist in these demonstrations and offer technical consultations."
