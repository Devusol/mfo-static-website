description-long: "Mineral Element Browser (MEOWSER) is an interactive educational ARDUINO project for all ages of students.  A computer display shows the Periodic Table of chemical elements.  The computer is linked to a wood cabinet containing many rocks.  Click on an element in the Periodic Table to illuminate the rocks in the cabinet containing that element.   Click on a rock to illuminate the elements in the Periodic Table in that rock.  Science reports about these Rock/Element relationships are displayed during navigation.  MEOWSER demonstrates Chemistry, Woodworking, Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, and Arduino integration of these components."
