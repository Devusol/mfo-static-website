excerpt: "I will be once again entering a Star Trek Enterprise NCC-1701 themed power racer."
description: "This will be the return of the Star Ship Enterprise to compete in this years Power Racing event. The Enterprise won the award for most moxie points at the 2017 Orlando Maker Faire as well as the most overall points for the weekend. For the 2018 Orlando Maker Faire it won the most moxie points and came in second for most overall points. One of the unique features is that the engines double as T-shirt cannons!"
