  description: "We are a network of students, educators, mathematicians & STEM professionals that facilitate engaging math enrichment events and classes for local K-12 students in Florida. We focus on logic activities that promote creative problem solving & critical thinking.  We encourage people to play with mathematics and make mathematics their own by creating math stories, math art, doing math collaborations as well as exploring many other creative ways to enjoy the beauty of mathematics. Since the pandemic, we have broadened our reach to students that are far away because we now provide a variety of online classes and events.  We are now bringing back events like math festivals, workshops and our annual Girlsâ€™ Math Competition back in person. Orlando Math Circle together with University of Florida Math Circle and CYFAMAT have founded the Florida Math Circle Network to expand mathematics outreach and spread the joy of mathematics throughout the state of Florida.

Orlando Math Circle was founded in the tradition of Eastern European math circles where they have been part of the education culture for over a hundred years. Math circles were brought to the US in the 1990s by immigrants who wanted to provide a similar experience for their children. Now math circles can be found all over the United States, many affiliated with universities."
