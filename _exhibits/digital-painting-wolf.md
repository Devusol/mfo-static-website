description: "At my booth, I will show my art and share my experiences.  Last year, I was dressed up as my character Nimmy.  This year, I will be dressed up as my crazy character Highlight.  I want to inspire creativity and show people that with practice, anything is possible."
description-long: "Hi, my name is Sienna and I am a 17 year old digital artist.  I have been drawing digitally for over two years now, but I have been drawing in general all my life.  I was never really good at traditional art, but everything changed when I saw my step sister doing digital art.  I started drawing with a mouse which was pretty hard, but over time, I got a tablet and my art life exploded!  This is my third year of exhibiting at Maker Faire, and I am excited to see all the other Makers again, and have a blast with young entrepreneurs like myself.  All my drawings are kid friendly, I have never even thought about drawing mature content.  I mostly draw either my characters from the stories I wrote, fan art, or just random illustrations.  I will be accepting donations and with every donation I will draw a picture of the donator or one of their family members.  There is no specific amount, it's just any donation.  At my booth, I will show my first digital painting using a mouse and my first digital painting using a tablet.  I want to show kids that with practice, you can do anything!  I will have some other things at my booth like photo slides, live drawing, coloring sheets and crayons, and some information cards to my YouTube channel and Instagram page.  I want to make myself known to the public and hopefully get more requests for drawings.  I hope to see you all at this years Maker Faire!  Let's make it another good one!"

  description: "I am a 16 year old digital artist.  I have been drawing for over a year, and it has completely changed my life.  My step sister and my mother are my biggest inspirations.  They both draw and they help me to improve.  Ever since my first drawing I have not stopped practicing, and now I have over 200 drawings.  Art helps me with my depression and anxiety, and I would love to share my experience and my art with others.  "
