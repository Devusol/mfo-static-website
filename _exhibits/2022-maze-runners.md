permalink: /exhibits/maze-runners/
exhibit-id: 22-123
space-number: Unassigned
description: "This exhibit will be a reconfigurable maze with small robots that attempt to solve the maze. "
description-long: "The maze will be a pegboard with a series of small pieces of corregated plastic that can be placed on the pegboard using small pins on the bottom of the board pieces. Once a valid maze is created, a series of small robots will attempt to solve the maze using an array of sensors to map their surroundings. The maze exhibits adaptive autonomy and decision-making in robotic applications."
