excerpt: "These two brands join forces to bring you nerdy jewelry and 3d printed cosplay accessories!"
description: "Terecook Studios is a 3d printing house that makes hard-to-find, custom-designed cosplay accessories. Every cosplay seems to have that one !@#$ thing you can't find or make to save your life; Terecook specializes in that one !@#$ thing. 3d printed accessories are great, because they're more durable and less bulky than foam, but lighter and more affordable than metal. Available for any custom 3d printing orders, and we do a few props and toys too!

Dice Charm School has been teaching your dice to behave themselves since 2016, specializing in polyhedral dice jewelry with the highest roll facing out for luck. (Natural 20s not guaranteed.) We also offer hand-drawn pins, pride jewelry, and a few other nerdy treasures!"
