    description: "I'm a scenic artist named Yoshi that creates many Halloween type props as well as spiritual style art pieces. I am currently creating biodegradable and Eco friendly paper mache skulls and resin skulls. The skulls are handmade and created for home decor, office decor and even for a plant holder. I've created a few that are neon and fluorescent. I have also created flower-embed resin necklaces as well that glow.  I love incorporating the spiritual, odd and weird to each project, some may say I have a light way of creating spooky crafts.
