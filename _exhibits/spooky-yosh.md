excerpt: "Spooky, adorable, and curiously dark crafts from home decor to jewelry. All created by a scenic artistic named Yoshi!"
description: "From dark macabre paper mache human skulls that hold succulents to hand painted canvas pieces that have spooky images that can glow in black light! All handmade by a scenic and graphic designer native to the orlando area. Yoshi has been in love with the Halloween realm of theme park entertainment and she designs her own interpretation of the bizarre and macabre. "

  description: "I'm a scenic artist named Yoshi that creates many Halloween type props as well as spiritual style art pieces. I am currently creating biodegradable and Eco friendly paper mache skulls and resin skulls. The skulls are handmade and created for home decor, office decor and even for a plant holder. I've created a few that are neon and fluorescent. I have also created flower-embed resin necklaces as well that glow.  I love incorporating the spiritual, odd and weird to each project, some may say I have a light way of creating spooky crafts.
