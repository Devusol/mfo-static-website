Sora&#039;s full-time, fully accredited program is comprised of creative lessons (like \"The Science of Marvel,\" \"Engineering Rollercoasters,\" and \"Philosophy, Logic, and the Art of Argumentation\") and self-directed independent assignments that lead students to tackle questions from \"What if Monet was a contemporary artist working with digital tools?\" to \"What are the economics behind building a tiny house community?\" and beyond.

Learn how our customizable curriculum will encourage hands-on learning and re-ignite their curiosity. "
