description: "Learn to solder and help us crowd build 3D print lights for people living in light poverty."
description-long: "Students solder and 3D print LED lights for 1.3 billion people living in light poverty like Hailey and Maria. Some day they would like to be doctors so they can help their village, but cannot study once the sun sets because they do not have a source of light. Our students learn that Making gives them power to make a direct impact on the world around them and brings purpose to their learning. A disproportionate number of females are pursuing engineering because they see it as a way to use their STEM skills to do good in the world. Come help us solder as we try to build 100 lights for people like Hailey and Maria.   "

  description: "www.currentgeneration.org is a group of high school students who design, 3D print and solder lights for their international friends who are living in light poverty. The makers learn the physics and engineering curriculum by learning how to solder, design in CAD, Ohm&#039;s and Kirchoff&#039;s Laws. More importantly, they become empowered when they realize that making can be used to solve real problems for real people. We are having a disproportionate number of females deciding to pursue engineering because of their desire to use the STEM skills to make a difference in the world. The recipients of the lights are now able to complete their homework after the sunsets and complete their education. There is a short video on our webpage.  "
