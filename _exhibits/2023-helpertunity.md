The small charity collects and provides upcycled activity resources, craft supplies, and maker-training for its participants' creative and purposeful voluntainment.  Helpertunity's community-volunteers visit nursing homes and other facilities to provide crafts classes, adaptive games, and holiday festivities.  Our volunteers also pack kits for patients' independent/in-room activity.  With our year 2020-2030 focus on eco-beneficial arts, technology, and vintage carnival-style gameplay; Helpertunity has been rescuing, researching, advocating, and prototyping ways for greater adaptive technology, accessible maker spaces & supplies, and eco play-space access for all ages and abilities."
