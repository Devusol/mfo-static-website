description: "Steampunk Inspired Leatherware and more."
description-long: "With 6 years experience, we make items for the day to day use with steampunk as the inspiration. We understand that leather is a natural substance and very versatile, but it makes things that can last a long time and that means less waste. Our items range in size and shape, and they are usually customized for the individual. Some of the items are: coffee cup wraps, straps for vests, belts, wallets, ID cases, can coozies, hair barrettes, tea duelers, bookmarks, and more."

  description: "A home hobby shop that has taken adopted Steampunk inspired leather crafting. We strive to make things new, fresh and unique.  Our items vary in size and can be big or small, all with the customer's design in mind. We make personal items that take hours of pre-planning, designing and learning of new crafts in order to complete, many are more than just leather. Using drafting knowledge, we review all parts of the design prior to construction, details, and even measurements to assure that everything fits exactly to how we need it. We are ever growing in our makings, items, ideas, and costume builds. Please check out our links to see all we have accomplished."
