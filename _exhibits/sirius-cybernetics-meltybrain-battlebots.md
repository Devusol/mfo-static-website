excerpt: "Back for the second year, now spinning in two weight classes!"
description: "Last year we competed for the first time ever, with a brand new beatleweight robot, Halo! We took second place after a roller coaster of an event. It's since been to the UK, where we fought the best of the best in Bugglebots. Now making its third competitive appearance, we hope it will be deadlier and tougher than ever.

We've also taken the electronics of Halo and miniaturized them, resulting in a one-wheeled one-pound Meltybrain spinner, Hit-and-Spin! We hope the titanium terror makes for a good show, if nothing else!"
