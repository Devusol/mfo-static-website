description: "Demonstration and display of the Boxify Enclosure"
description-long: "This is a demonstration and display of our enclosure with a variety of 3D printers printing our unique and open-source interfaces in various colors + a card holder that interfaces with it. It's a great demonstration of how you can make connectors without magnets and incorporate the design into any project.

It's also a fun opportunity to teach people about a wide range of 3D printing knowledge."

  description: "We make the Boxify Enclosure, it is a low-cost 3D printer enclosure for small and mid-sized 3D printers (including the popular Prusa Mk3 and Mk4), some of our designs are already on printables (print sharing site) and are open source.

We are currently on kickstarter (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jvb-vat-engineering/boxify-enclosure-a-user-friendly-3d-printer-enclosure) with a campaign to fund the first production run of these modular and customizable enclosures. If funded we will be able to finish the designs and release them as an open source solution while also offering kits and accessories.

We have attended MRRF and ERRF and just found out about the Orlando Maker Faire two days ago. "
