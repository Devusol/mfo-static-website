excerpt: "I have created an app for musicians called Tonality – a comprehensive guide to chords, scales, and much more. It has tons of interactive features to demonstrate, including the ability to play it like a musical instrument, plug in a MIDI keyboard, or identify chords from acoustic instruments like guitars. Tonality is also accessible for the blind."
description: "The ultimate music theory reference tool for musicians of all skill levels. Tonality allows you to view and listen to a large database of piano chords and scales and features a chord-recognition tool that can identify chords you play on your instrument. You can run Tonality as an AUv3 MIDI receiver and view chords that match MIDI input you route to it, or as a MIDI source and send chords to other apps. 

Tonality features over 1,000 chords and scales, a reverse searcher to find chords/scales that contain certain notes, the ability to create custom chords/scales, detailed information about each (including guitar/ukulele charts), scale fingerings, an interactive circle of fifths, and more. It is fully compatible and interactive with MIDI keyboards as well, and can display chords in sheet music form in real time. Tonality also features a detailed ear training section and a musical terminology dictionary.

Tonality is completely customizable and accessible for the blind."

I am also interested in music – I have played piano for over 11 years as well as trumpet and bass for four years. In my spare time I have been working on an app called Tonality, which is designed to be the ultimate tool for musicians of all levels. I went to Maker Faire once with my high school robotics team (Roaring Riptide)."
