  description: "I've been doing combat robotics for a little under a year. I was lucky enough to build my Fingertech Viper kit at Maker MIA (https://www.facebook.com/makemiamakerspace/) with Team Witch doctor. As of writing this I have taken part in 3 different competitions and took second twice and third once. I enjoy watching combat robotics on TV and enjoy it."
