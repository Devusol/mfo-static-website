excerpt: "Are you an accidental historian?  Every day we document the world around us in so many ways, preserving intimate depictions of our lives that future historians may use to understand our world. Learn about how we all preserve history without even realizing it and complete a fun make and take project inspired by our newest exhibit, The Accidental Historian!"
description: "You might be a historian without even realizing it! That’s certainly true of many bloggers, urban sketchers, photographers, and more. Learn about the History Center's newest limited run exhibit, The Accidental Historian, which explores how individuals who are absorbed in documenting the world of today accidentally become some of Central Florida’s finest historians for the future. Our booth will also feature a fun make and take activity inspired by our Accidental Historian exhibit!"
