description: "Worst Case Scenario, a 4-bar lifter/flipper combat robot. "
description-long: "A bot whose name came about as its first competition drew closer. With dream-designs in mind, realistic compromises must always be made. It name isn&#039;t intimidating, because it isn&#039;t YOUR worst case scenario, its own design is the worst-case, time-crunch compromise of what we want to build, and had reasonable time to build. Behold, The mediocrity! 

Worst Case Scenario is inspired by such bots as Biohazard, with it&#039;s 4-bar lifter/flipper arm. If weight permits, WCS will be powered by six 18v Dewalt drills, 4 on drive, and 2 on the weapon. "
