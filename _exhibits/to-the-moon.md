excerpt: "Led by our 3rd grade design thinking students, our \"To the Moon!\" booth will invite attendees to take part in some out of this world science! Students will provide 4 separate \"space\" missions all in one booth! Attendees will have the opportunity to make, take, and launch a bottle rocket, build catapults to defend the \"moon\" from an invasion, design and sew some stuffed space figures, and have their bottle rockets take a return flight back to earth on a zip-line race."

  description: "Students from grades 3 through 6 of Park Maitland School take part in programmed Design Thinking classes twice a week. In their newly renovated Maker Space, students hone their 21st Century Skills of collaboration, problem solving, creativity, and critical thinking through project based learning. Students are encouraged to tinker and are taught the design process through different modes and hands-on learning experiences. Science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math all play a role in their learning! Students further share their learning to authentic audiences through showcases, hands-on exhibits, and by creating learning experiences for others."
