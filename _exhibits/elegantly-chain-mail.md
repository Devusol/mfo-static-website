  description: "I have been making chain mail jewelry for 4 years now. I started because I have a hard time finding jewelry that fits me and doesn't effect my delicate skin. when I started I found a lot of people were interested in the jewelry I was wearing so I decided to try selling it. so I started to sell online now I think I am ready to get out there and sell at events."
