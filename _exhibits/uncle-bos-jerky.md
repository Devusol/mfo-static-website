  description: "about 20 years ago, a friend of the family gave us a food dehydrator, using the recipe that came with the unit I made some Beef jerky. It was awful! It was worse than the generic store bought stuff. As I make my own steak rubs, wing sauces etcetera ... I decided to make my own jerky recipe. After about 6 months of trial and error, I came up with my original recipe jerky. Using this as a base, I have created 7 additional flavors. "
