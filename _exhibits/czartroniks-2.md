description: "A collection of unique, homemade electronic musical instruments and interactions. "
description-long: "This interactive exhibit will encourage you to pick up and play one of a kind electronic musical instruments.  A wide range of synthesized and MIDI instruments will be available, including drums, guitars, bass pedals, keytars, and other hybrids.  Most are designed for musical novices to easily enjoy.

Have a look under the hood and learn about the design process and music theory as it applies to producing MIDI and synthesized sound.  Or simply listen to some live performances and demonstrations.  

Instruments are a combination of recycled/reconfigured instruments with upgraded control schemes and functionality.  Some are built from non-existence!  They are also decorated with collage and recycled art techniques or animatronics to create visual and mechanical interest.  All use Arduino microcontrollers to synthesize their own sounds or trigger MIDI notes or samples from WAV Trigger boards."

  description: "Ron Czarnik has been programming, making music, building things and taking them apart for most of his life.  He discovered Arduino microcontrollers at Maker Faire a few years back and since that time he has produced an evolving multitude of unique electronic musical instruments.  His work, twice featured on Instructables.com, incorporates many disciplines including decoupage/collage, recycled art, painting, electronics, woodworking, animatronics, music theory, sound synthesis and interface design.
