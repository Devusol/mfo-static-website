description: "Entering Robot Ruckus with three combat robots! 1-lb antweight \"Bolt Harvester,\" 3-lb beetleweight \"Mood Swing,\" and 15-lb dogeweight \"Ice Cream Slamwich.\""
description-long: "This is Buzzkill Robotics' 2nd trip to Maker Faire Orlando and we are very excited to participate in this year's Robot Ruckus! We are bringing back our antweight \"Bolt Harvester\" along with two completely new designs, beetleweight \"Mood Swing\" and dogeweight \"Ice Cream Slamwich.\" Bolt Harvester has become an undercutter spinner but still has a mostly 3D-printed chassis. Mood Swing is a ring spinner with the ring and drive modules being completely independent systems. It's like two robots stuck together!"

  description: "This page is for my combat robotics team that only consists of me, at the moment. I'm an alumnus of the University of South Florida and I'm an avid maker. I've built remote-controlled lawnmowers and a spot welder out of parts from an old microwave, so this seemed like the natural next step. I want to design things that the public can see and...well...see how they do. It will be great to see how others build things to meet the needs of others. That's the real reason behind joining the Maker Faire group. I enjoy what I do and want to join others who think the way that I do."
