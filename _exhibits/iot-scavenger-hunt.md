excerpt: "An electronic scavenger hunt using multiple IoT nodes scattered throughout Maker Faire. "
description: "Visiting Maker Faire? Document your travels through Maker Faire by entering your secret code on the IoT node at each participating exhibit.  Track your progress and compete to visit more exhibits than your friends in a set period of time.  Win swag and get a certificate mapping your participation.

Are you an exhibitor and would you like to host an IoT Scavenger Hunt Station?

As an exhibitor all you have to do to host a station is agree is to let us put the station somewhere in your booth accessible to the public, and let us plug it into your power strip. Â  We're hoping that the Scavenger Hunt will encourage folks to roam more widely around Maker Faire, and bring them into contact with more exhibitors.
