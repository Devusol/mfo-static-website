description: "Ra Kura is the Florida Base of the Rebel Legion – a worldwide Star Wars costuming organization comprised of and operated by Star Wars fans. Formed in 2000, the Rebel Legion is a global volunteer organization of enthusiasts who enjoy, express, and share their interest of quality Star Wars costuming with the fan community. Rebel Legion members create and wear costumes of the hero characters from the Star Wars saga, which includes but is not limited to the six films, comics, books, games, and television shows. As the premier Rebel costuming group in the Star Wars community, members volunteer their time to appear at Star Wars related functions, charity fundraisers and other community events.

Besides our ‘Heroes’ costumes, our worldwide membership often choose to give back to their communities (through costumed volunteer activities and charity events). No one can provide the public with a greater range of Star Wars costumes, nor a more personable, interactive, face to face experience.

Along with our partner organizations the Florida Garrison of the 501st Legion, The Wookiee Workshop, Mandolarion Mercenaries, R2 Builders’ Club, Dark Empire – Spire of the Storm and Galactic Academy, we bring smiles to our home State of Florida."
