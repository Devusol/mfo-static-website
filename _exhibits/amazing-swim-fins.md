excerpt: "Why are swim fins just flexible boards?  Finally we have developed fins from the ground up for their real purpose - Propulsion."
description: "Why can't we be a bit more like fish?  TECreation has answered that with an emphatic, \"We can!\"  After years of swimming with ancient fins, frustration  has lead to a vast improvement of our method of propulsion through the water.   New swim fins designed from the ground up for hydrodynamic efficiency and ease of use are 20 to 40% more efficient than the boards you are using now.  We will be demonstrating how these work with our special test tank.  Try it yourself."

    description: "Born into a family that loved water, David became part fish.  After years of sailing, swimming, SCUBA diving, sailboarding, hang gliding, and an engineering degree he decided swim fins need a serious update and TECreation was born.  The foray into swim fin design started in 2006 and has caused him to join the Inventors Council of Central Florida, eventually bringing it into the 21st century.  He has learned about urethane casting and prototyping techniques.  Now he is engaging with the US military to design fins for them."
