description-long: "Our exhibit consists of two robots;  \"Battlesuit: Hyperchicken\" and \"Ham Slamwich Deluxe\".

\"Battlesuit: Hyperchicken\" is a 250 pound quadruped with two lifting arms piloted by a rubber chicken. The robot is meant to resemble the 'power loader' from 'Aliens II' albeit driven by a chicken. It will be approximately a 36\" cube in volume (foot tip to foot tip) when completed. Legs are driven by twisted string actuators connected to brushless motors from electric skateboards. Each leg has 3 degrees of freedom and the arms have two a piece. It is controlled by a custom Cortex M4 board and kinematics firmware. Each motor controller connects to an encoder to provide feed back. 

\"Ham Slamwich Deluxe\" is a 30 pound ham sandwich shaped robot. It is an aluminum version of the original \"Ham Slamwich\". The original has fought in Atlanta during DragonCon but is not suited for the event at Orlando Maker Faire due to it being a tad delicate. The original sandwich is driven by two electric brushless motors and a hacked belt sander. It's primary purpose is to deliver sandwiches. The deluxe features a rotating bit of cheese that acts as a ring spinner. 

Both robots are fully electric RC vehicles powered by LiPo batteries."
