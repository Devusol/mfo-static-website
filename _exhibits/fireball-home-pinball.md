excerpt: "Its a pinball machine. With a Raspberry Pi. We made it. It's awesome."
description: "It all started when… I saw a Fireball Home edition playfield on eBay locally – I purchased it ($135!) with the intent of lighting the lamps with an Arduino, framing it, and hanging it on the wall of my office. My boys saw it and asked “can you make it play?” – Now this was either an innocent question – or a challenge by my sons. Not one to let a challenge go unanswered, I started thinking about the problem – how hard could it be?

We’d need to:

- Read switches
- Turn on &amp; off Lamps (LEDs)
- Activate solenoids
- Keep score

I’d built complex projects with Arduino before, and I’d been looking for a Raspberry Pi GPIO project. I’d purchased some when they first launched, but STILL hadn’t done GPIO work. We’d just finished teaching our first Intro to Raspberry Pi classes at FamiLAB, so I was really excited to try it.

After a year+ of effort (nights &amp; weekends as we had time) - we had a playable pinball machine. Its still a little buggy, but we love it, and we hope you will too :)"
