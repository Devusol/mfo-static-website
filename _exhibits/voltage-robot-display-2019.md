excerpt: "FRC 386 Team Voltage's 2016 robot and demonstration. Small robots for driving around and information about our team."
description: "FRC Team Voltage will be displaying the robot created in the 2016 year for competition.  We plan to allow kids to attempt to drive the robot in order to show them what FIRST Robotics Teams do.  We will also be answering any questions people may have about the robot, our team, and FIRST to help spread awareness of engineering programs to help kids and teens get into engineering through robotics. Our team represents the ability to inspire younger kids to pursue and excel in STEM related fields, that everyone is always welcome in FIRST, and that everyone has a place. Our team is a group of dedicated and hardworking individuals that strive to bestow the beliefs of \"hardwork is the only work\" in all people we come by."
