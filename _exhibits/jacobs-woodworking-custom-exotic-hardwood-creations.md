  description: "Jacobs Woodworking is a family business that was started through that encouragement of my wife.   I have always loved working with wood, and have made things for our home and gifts for family for many years.  In 2011 I was in a car accident that has caused me to be unable to have a traditional job.  My wife encouraged me to do something I loved, even if it only for a few hours a day.  My family helps will all aspects of the business, my wife does the accounting and marketing, my daughter does the graphic design.  We made our debut at Makerâ€™s Fair last year! "
