description: "The One Man Band, Marc Dobson puts on an inspiring performance playing 9.1 self-created instruments, at once. 2019 is Marc's 30th year making living as musician and entertainer. His repertoire aims at songs every age should recognize covering the 60’s thru to today with a mix of Rock, Country, Pop and more. With improv comedic antics, no two shows are alike which maybe is why Marc has been performing yearly at many fairs since the inception of his One Man Band in 2010."

    description: "My day job is performing as a real, manually controlled One Man Band playing 9.1 instruments at once on a rig I've created and continue to enhance. I perform mainly at fairs and festivals across North America. In 2019, I've added and am still developing a (costume) singing robot \"Bot The Robot\" and I am also a Singing Santa :)  "
