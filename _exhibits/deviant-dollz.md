description: "I make avant guard art dollz that are a bit odd. They are a combination of creepy and beautiful--  scary and pretty.  I also make a line of Day of the Dead Animals.  From dogs to cats to bunnies to dinosaurs to turtles and everything in between, all of the animals are ready and dressed in their finest Day of the Dead flowers and hats.  I use primarily upcycled things to create my art.  Most of them are originally headed for the trash and I breath new life into them again."

    description: "I have been a creator since I was little.  Whether it was crayon to paper or making a lavish mansion for my barbies out of cardboard boxes and twine, my imagination has always run wild.  I started making Deviant Dollz after a Halloween party.  I made a handful as props and guests loved them.  One thing led to another and Deviant Dollz was born. My philosophy with art is not caring a supply is meant to do.  I care what it can do.  I experiment.  I take chances.  I don't analyze.  I love what I create and I hope that someone else in the world digs it as well.  "
