  description: "Urban Sketchers is a nonprofit organization dedicated to raising the artistic, storytelling, and educational value of location drawing, promoting its practice, and connecting people around the world who draw on location where they live and travel. We aim to show the world, one drawing at a time.
Since its inception in 2016, the Orlando Urban Sketchers Chapter, a member of the International organization, serves the Central Florida community by offering monthly on-location sketching meetups and hosting urban sketching workshops and demos. We interact and engage with local organizations, showcasing urban sketching art and supporting young artists&#039; education.
We document Orlando&#039;s and Central Florida community life via Sketch-Reportage art form and share our stories with the world, One Drawing at a Time."
