description: "The Central Florida Steampunk Association is dedicated to bringing the colorful and imaginative world of Steampunk to anyone interested in learning more about it.  The shortest description of steampunk is \"Victorian Science Fiction\", which was bought to life with authors like Jules Verne.  In recent years the genre has blossomed to become a world-wide sensation, influencing musicians, artists, and even fashion designers.  Our members have used their skills to create works of art through a variety of materials.  We have leather workers, metal workers, jewelry makers, artists, musicians, costumers, prop makers, and writers.  Many of our members also teach classes to pass on these skills."

Our members have experience in leather working, jewelry making, sewing, prop making, simple wearable electronics, and much more.  We frequently hold classes in an effort to share our knowledge base and encourage learners to try new skills.  We'll have several items on display to showcase some of the skills and classes we have to offer.  "
