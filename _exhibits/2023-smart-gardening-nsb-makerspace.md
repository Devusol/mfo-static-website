description: "A Smart Vertical Garden that brings design, gardening, and programming together!"
description-long: "Our Friends of the Makerspace Group have come together and found common interests among all of our metal working, wood working, 3D printing, tool & die hobbies. We have a handful of projects that have brought our Makers from all different backgrounds together. 

Our main exhibit is on our smart, aquaponic vertical garden. This DIY can be printed, assembled, programmed, fitted and functioning in a day (or two depending on your print sizes)! One of our Resident Makers dreamed up the idea of a sustainable, beginner-friendly system to grow herbs, small vegetables and fruits right on your desktop, in your window-sill, or even outside. The exhibit is small, but scalable enough to create a full garden on your porch or in your backyard.

One of our Resident Makers will also be highlighting the process of retrofitting a Hurco CNC Milling machine by replacing the original 1980's control system with modern electronics. This has been one of the most interesting and challenging projects taken on by our Friends of the Makerspace team! 

We'll also have small exhibits of some of our welding, lathe and plastics projects for Makers to come explore and learn about. "
