excerpt: "Provides a showcase and demonstration of creations made from Maker-related skills that are no longer common knowledge since the advent of computer technology (such as using machinists' hand tools, manual drafting, restoring vintage tools, etc.)  You don't need a fancy $15,000 CNC machine to make a wooden chair - all you need is a chisel, a saw, a hand plane, and a couple of Maker skills lost to history... until now."
description: "I provide short demonstrations on what I (Alan Longfellow) call \"lost skills\" such as using hand tools to make accurate measurements, using a wood plane rather than an expensive milling machine, manual drafting equipment rather than clunky CAD software, restoring old, rusty yard-sale tools with nothing but steel wool and WD-40, among many other things.

Small but useful skills like how to find the center of a board, how to divide a line, or how to properly use a micrometer caliper, chisel, hand saw, or vernier caliper will be demonstrated.  The centerpiece of my exhibit will be an accurate, precise, custom-built 3D printer dubbed the \"Messingdrucker I\" that I made completely from precision-machined parts intended to demonstrate the need for an accurate, rigid 3D printer in the industry, along with a small (2 ft by 4 ft) model train display featuring vintage 1950s-era Lionel model trains.  So much innovation has been lost to history that I feel that it is important to \"dig it all up\" and use it for the greater good of the Maker community!"

 I love making things and bettering my skill set.  I use \"lost skills\" that people usually no longer have, such as using manual machine tools and vintage woodworking equipment.  I want to share these skills with people in the area and help get them started if they want to join us Makers!"
