Limited edition fine art prints on paper, canvas &amp; metal.
Original fractal animation showings throughout the exhibit.
Demonstrations of different 2D and 3D fractal applications.
Sharing information regarding the next International Fractal Art Symposium."
description-long: "Fractal art is a digital art form where mathematical formulas are placed into a feedback loop using a process called iteration. The iterated code is processed by a computer application known as a fractal plotter which translates the formulas into complex graphs. Since computers have no understanding of aesthetics, an artist drives the entire process by manipulating the graphs and applying artistic theory.  Fractal mathematics is very closely related to the study of Chaos and fractal geometry is manifested throughout the natural world. Fractal art is recursive by nature and is themed by shapes or patterns that are repeated at different dimensions.  A unique attribute of fractal art is that it contains infinite detail, therefore any section of the graph (no matter how small) can be magnified and rendered at high resolution to any size without losing detail.

Joseph Presley has been working with fractal art for over 20yrs and will be exhibiting some of his recent still works in the form of limited edition fine art prints that are ready for matting and framing as well as finished masterworks such as gallery wrapped canvas prints embellished with clear acrylics and hi-res prints on metal.  This display will also include original fractal animations for viewing as well as information and demonstrations regarding the tools and creation of this type of art.  

Joseph is also involved with coordinating the International Fractal Art Symposiums.  The next iteration will be held in Florida and he is excited share information about this upcoming event.  The last conference was held in Spain where there were fractal artists from over 16 countries participated.  The meeting that will be held in Sarasota during 2021 will include an academic track for fractal artists world wide as well as a public track and a public education track connecting the city and local schools with the event, building awareness and understanding of this beautifully complex art from."

  description: "Joseph Presley is a fractal artist based in Bradenton who combines mathematics with modern technology to render multi-layered fractals into
beautiful and deeply emotional artistic expressions.  He has practiced fractal art since the late 90â€™s and is a true pioneer of this stimulating new art form which is recognized by its multifaceted patterns and infinite detail. Internationally published since 2005, coordinator of the International Fractal Art Symposiums and winner of multiple international contests, Joseph has contributed to the evolution of fractal art as an artist, lecturer and instructor. His diversity in fractal art continues to legitimize its relevance as an art form.
