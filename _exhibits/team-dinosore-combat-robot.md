  description: "I am six years old and built and fought my first ant weight robot last year at MakeMIA in Miami.  My robot's name is Dinosore and he is a wedge bot with a vertical spinner.  I have participated in five robot battles in the past year, including Maker Faire Orlando last year, and really enjoy the competition and sportsmanship.  And a special thanks to Team Witch Doctor for helping me along the way."
