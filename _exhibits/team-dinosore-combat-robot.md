description: "DinoSore, a 1lb wedge bot with a vertical spinner, and Slip, a 1lb wedge bot with a flipper, driven by Bradley Blanton and Matthew Tobias, respectively.  Bradley has participated in five robot competitions over the past year, including Maker Faire Orlando last year, and he is excited to get back in the box!  And this will be Matthew's second competition after he got his robot battle introduction at Robot Riot Summer 2019 in Miami in August 2019."

    description: "I am six years old and built and fought my first ant weight robot last year at MakeMIA in Miami.  My robot's name is Dinosore and he is a wedge bot with a vertical spinner.  I have participated in five robot battles in the past year, including Maker Faire Orlando last year, and really enjoy the competition and sportsmanship.  And a special thanks to Team Witch Doctor for helping me along the way."
