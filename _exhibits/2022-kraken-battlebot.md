  description: "CE Robots has been building robots since 2002, which makes this our 20 year anniversary of building bots. CE Robots is the team behind Kraken BattleBot, and while the bots have changed over the years the one thing that has remained the same is that we love building and hanging out with the friends we&#039;ve made competing in combat robots.
