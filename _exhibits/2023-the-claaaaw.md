description-long: "Step right up, Ladies and Gentlemen, Boys and Girls, Children of All Ages!  Test your skill at The Claaaaw!  Do you have what it takes to successfully pluck a 3d printed Makey from this marvelous machine?  Stop by and give it a try!

******************

Can you help print Makey robots for kids to win at Maker Faire? 

Use this model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:40212

Print between 2x & 3x size or 58mm to 87mm tall - These sizes work best with the claw. Bigger is POSSIBLE, but very difficult...

For PLA filament, it seems that three walls, 10% infill, with a 0.4mm nozzle works well. Not all filaments are created equal, so before printing many, print one at 58mm (2x) and drop it to see if breaks. The arm joints are typically the weak spot. 

Bring the Makeys to the Claaaaw - which will be in the Main Stage area by the Merch booth - Thank you!

Feel free to throw benchy boats in the mix too :)
