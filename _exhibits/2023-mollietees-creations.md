  description: "I am a single person business who has been sewing professionally for 3 years and for fun for more than ten! I started by tailoring the oversized t-shirts I found in thrift stores and at anime conventions to fit better and soon realized that that was just the beginning to what I could do with a sewing machine. I am an avid cosplayer and find great joy in the goth and geek culture!"
