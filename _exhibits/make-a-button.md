description: "Make a 1\" or 2.25\" button at Maker Faire Orlando using our art, or bring your own! We are bringing parts to make 5,000 1\" buttons and 5,000 2.25\" buttons - will you help us make 10,000 buttons in one weekend?!

We will have art with Makey the Maker Faire Robot, MakerFX Makerspace art, Maker Faire Orlando art, color-your-own options, and more. 

If you want to bring your own art, make sure it is on paper no thicker than a photo. Plain paper is best, and cardstock is too thick.

A $1 donation to The Maker Effect Foundation gets the parts to make a 2.25\" button or the parts to make TWO 1\" buttons!"

    description: "MakerFX Makerspace is a unique makerspace located in south Orlando and easily accessible by those in the area. This new makerspace is organize by a group of like minded individuals that saw a need for a new space on the south side or Orlando to fill in the geographic gaps. One of our goals is to work hand in hand with other local spaces in the Greater Orlando area. As a program of The Maker Effect Foundation, MakerFX strives to create unique classes, useful workspaces, and share ideas with the maker community.
