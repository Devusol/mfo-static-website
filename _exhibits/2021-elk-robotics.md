description: "Miami based team fielding Cannibal Mini and Junkyard Mutant in the 12lb weight class."
description-long: "Cannibal Mini: 12lb angled horizontal spinner wielding a 2.5lb asymmetrical AR500 bar. Due to the angle of the spinning bar the bot experiences unique gyroscopic effects that cause the front of he robot to lift up or be forced down in turns, depending of the turning direction. 

Junkyard Mutant: 12lb Ram bot. This bot is designed to use its whole weight and drive power to slam into its opponent, doing damage and controlling the fight. The mutant has 4 wheel drive with an independent motor on every wheel, a sturdy UHMW frame to tank hits, and a strong AR500 front plate to absorb damage and deliver impacts "
