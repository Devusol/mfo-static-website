excerpt: "As two self proclaimed geeks who love fan art, we often found that the art we would see at cons would be out of our price range. We decided we would try to make art that was still high quality but more affordable. Most of our art pieces range from $15 - $25. 

All of our paper art is digitally designed, cut out of paper, and them assembled by hand very carefully with a little bit of glue and sometimes tweezers. This makes each piece a unique work of art!

We also make a variety of vinyl decals and various housewares using premium quality outdoor vinyl."

People often think we sell prints, but we do not. Each art piece is a unique piece of layered paper art. All of our paper art is digitally designed, cut out of paper, and them assembled by hand very carefully with a little bit of glue and sometimes tweezers. This makes each piece a one of a kind work of art!

Our subject matter covers a wide variety of fandoms including Star Wars, Harry Potter, Sci-Fi, Superheroes, and Pop Culture. 

In addition to the paper art we make, we also design and cut vinyl decals that are suitable for your car, laptop, and other smooth surfaces. We also make a wide variety of geek-themed glassware from coffee cups to adult beverage glasses."
