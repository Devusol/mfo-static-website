excerpt: "A display of some of the collected works of story artist, illustrator, and designer Gabriella Serralles including original comics, original artwork, and fan art. Acrylic charm keychains and fun stickers can be found at my booth, as well as commission opportunities for original, entirely unique artwork made at the Fair for anyone who wants them."
description: "I’m a first generation Puerto Rican story artist and designer with a fierce passion for storytelling. With a passion and skill for storytelling, I combined the visual and traditional techniques in media. Writing was never enough, so I learned the art of visual storytelling so I could truly connect and engage with my audience, so the artwork at my booth was all created with that in mind. Featuring original comics and artwork alongside fanart, stickers, and acrylic charms, you can also commission me at the fair for completely unique and original artwork."

I communicate story and message following the work and style of Steve Ahn (Nickelodeon Studios, Cartoon Network, Dreamworks) and Phil Craven (Dreamworks). With a passion and skill for storytelling, I combined the visual and traditional techniques in media. Writing was never enough, so I learned the art of visual storytelling so I could truly connect and engage with my audience"
