excerpt: "Wanted: Makers with Raspberry Pi, Arduino and other electronics projects. The WorkBench Project Development Kit protects your electronics, and makes it easy to manage and transport your project. Plus - you'll be proud to show it off!"
description: "The Phase DockTM WorkBench prototyping solution is for Makers who are working with electronics and single-board computers such as Raspberry Pis and Arduinos. Many times electronics are screwed down to pieces of plywood, or not secured to anything. Screws in plywood make it hard to adjust the placement of components; failing to secure the project leaves it vulnerable to wires pulling out, or pieces getting lost. We have Maker friends who have moderate to large projects underway -- who simply cannot move their projects for fear of breaking a connection.

The Phase Dock WorkBench Project Development Kit solves these problems by creating a modular component-mounting system that lets Makers quickly assemble a wide variety of electronic components in exactly the right position to improve the wiring and button-pushing action. The WorkBench also protects the finished project with a sturdy cover, making it easy to slide the project into a backpack, toss it onto the front seat of a car, or into a box for shipping. And as a bonus, it makes every project look great/fabulous/snazzy/professional/cool/space-shippy, so everyone from a 7-year-old prodigy to a professional engineer can share their work with pride.

The WorkBench system consists of four main components. 1) An acrylic Base with a matrix of holes at precise intervals. 2) Four-legged plastic platforms we call \"Clicks.\" The Clicks securely click into the Base, and can easily be released, moved and repositioned to adjust the placement of the project components on the Base. 3) Plastic adapters that slide onto the Clicks. Single-board computers, sensors, breadboards, and other electronic components can be mounted onto these adapters, which we call \"Slides\". 4) A clear acrylic Cover that snaps onto the Base to protect the entire project and make it easy to transport. 

In the future, users will be able to access STL files for many of the Slides, and be able to design and 3D-print a customized Slide that will then attach to one of the standard Clicks. 

Our project status: The acrylic Base design, laser and thermo-forming production are complete and proven. 3D-printed versions of the Clicks and Slides are complete; these are being used by a number of Makers, Professional Engineers, and STEM Educators with their own electronic projects. 

We began selling kits online and at Maker Faire Bay Area in May. The kit include one Base, one Cover, five Clicks and three Slides, as well as a packet with screws, nuts, and other small parts that make the kit instantly usable. Just add your electronics! 

Our plan for the near future is to move the Clicks and Slides from 3D-printed to injection-molded versions. This will make stronger and better performing versions available at a lower cost to users."
