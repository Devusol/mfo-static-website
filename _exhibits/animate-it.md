excerpt: "I make animated cakes for children dying of cancer.  "
description: "Cake animation using microprocessors to control movement and sound of animated parts for cakes. For example, if I make a dog cake, the mouth opens and closes and barks, the paws tap, the ears wiggle and the tail wags. For a dragon, the wings flap, the mouth opens and roars, the tail wags and the claws move."
