The Power Racing Series is a series of races where teams race each other with power wheels that they have modified to go much faster than their stock speed. The series also includes an endurance race of 75 minutes. It's a series where people can learn new things and skills and to simply have fun."

For this project, we've searched Craigslist until we've found a Power Wheels that we thought was best for the project. A used Power Wheels was desired since we are going to mostly just keep the plastic covering of the Power Wheels and not use the stock motor or throttle. The Power Wheels we ended up going with is the Power Wheels Dune Racer."
