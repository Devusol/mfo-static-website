description-long: "Our tiny monsters range in all sizes and are open for adoption.  From the tiny Tiggywillows to the bigger Bogglets, we have gathered a wide assortment of colorful friends whose deepest wish is to meet you.  

Though they can look very sweet or have a bit of an attitude, many are shy and fragile and do not like rough play.  "

  description: "Two sisters and one goal... create unusual, whimsical and fantastic monsters.  With this in mind and encouraged from family and friends The Monster Cafe was born on Etsy in 2009.  Since then we have attended conventions of all types through Central Florida and Atlanta, Georgia. Our work has been featured in a gallery or two and we have joined a wonderful family of artisans, crafters and hobbyists."
