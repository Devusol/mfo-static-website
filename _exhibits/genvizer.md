description: "GenVizer specializes in 3D animation technology for video games and virtual reality products.  This year we have been working with simulation platforms like the Talon Simulations motion platform to create virtual theme park rides and tradeshow experiences like a “Racing Towards Christmas” and “Rock Monster”.  GenVizer also worked on a virtual reality trainer for masonry training programs where students learn how to lay block using the HTC Vive. Stop by our table to learn how to make virtual reality based projects for yourself."
