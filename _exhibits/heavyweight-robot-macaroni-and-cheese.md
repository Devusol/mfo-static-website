excerpt: "Triplets Spiral, Noodle, and Elbow enter 2 at a time to fight as Macaroni and Cheese at Robot Ruckus 2019!"
description: "Robotic triplets \"Spiral\", \"Noodle\", and \"Elbow\" enter this year's Robot Ruckus 2019 as a heavyweight entry \"Macaroni and Cheese\"
Each 120lb robot is identical and constructed of a welded steel AR400 frame with a wide stance and angular profile. The bots feature 6\" grinding disks which spin nearly 10,000rpm to shower the arena in sparks.
The robots will compete 2 at a time, as all 3 would be too heavy."

  description: "Get Rekt Robotics is run by Brian Bray, a mechanical engineer out of Dallas, Texas.
I have competed in beetleweight combat robotics in the Dallas area (under Texas Robotic Combat organization)
Additionally, I competed with his senior design team at International Robogames 2017 with 220lb fighting robot \"Cavalier\" as driver.
I was the designer of a 250lb heavyweight \"Bellator\" for the 2019 Battlebots televised competition, in which my robot was selected to compete, however network conflicts regarding sponsorship forced us to withdraw.
When I am not building combat robots, I also enjoy other high-powered radio controlled vehicles, including a 10ft 50lb cargo aircraft which debuted (and crashed spectacularly) at FliteFest South in 2018"
