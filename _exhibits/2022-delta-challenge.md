description: "Delta challenge is both a tabletop and full size game designed to challenge your teamwork abilities."
description-long: "Delta Challenge is a tabletop game prototype that we would like to show at Maker Faire.  To make it even more fun we are constructing a full size (human) version of the game just for Maker Faire.  On display will also be tabletop versions and examples of how it was prototyped and developed.

The game uses challenge cards to instruct users on how to set up the challenge board as well as the challenge that must be undertaken.  Once the timer starts the team of 2-3 players pull their game slider to maneuver the central game piece together.  The game piece is used to magnetically pick up other game pieces and place them in the location defined by the challenge card.  All three challenges must be completed before the timer runs out to win!
