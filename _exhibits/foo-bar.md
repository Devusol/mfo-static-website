description-long: "Mostly 3D printed, 150 gram, combat robot with horizontal blade. Controlled by a custom built DSM2 transmitter stuffed into a Futaba Magnum Sport pistol grip radio which has been gutted except for it's potentiometers and replaced by a teensy LC reading the A/D, processing mixing and other special features, and sending the data to a Spektrum LP5DSM transmitter module."
