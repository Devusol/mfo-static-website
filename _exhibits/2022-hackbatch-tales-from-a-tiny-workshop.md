description: "A robot on the rise and beams of fantastic LED light are on display at the Hackbatch exhibit!"
description-long: "I make things in a tiny workshop tucked away in my bedroom closet. A single workbench and some basic tools are used to build robots, make art and videos, and all sorts of fun lights! 

I will have a robot in a prototype phase on display. This robot is a three wheeled droid-like bot made from salvaged parts and infused with some 3D printing magic.

Also at the exhibit is a fun row of LED tube lights with some demos and animation flows that will leave the eye satisfied!

Additionally I will have some of my drawings and plans on display to demonstrate that making things is a process from idea to planning and fabrication. Most times this is a chaotic but creative endeavor.

I want to show the folks who come to maker faire what Iâ€™ve been working on and share a bit about what I want to do next!"
