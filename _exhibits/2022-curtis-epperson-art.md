description: "I create art completely out of words, and use the words that tell the story of the art!"
description-long: "With every piece I do, my goal is not only to entertain you,
but also to inspire and educate you!

All of my art is made entirely of words,
and all of the words and phrases describe the art,
telling fun facts about each piece!

No word is ever repeated,
and every letter is individually hand-drawn!

I like to think of my art as a puzzle meets a word search, but
most importantly, a beautiful piece of art for any home or office!"
