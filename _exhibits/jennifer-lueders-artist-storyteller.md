excerpt: "This art exhibit is an exhibit containing various themes of whimsy and delightful watercolors and drawn illustrative work of artist and storyteller, Jennifer Lueders."
description: "My name is Jennifer Lueders, I am an Appalachian American and an artist and storyteller.  I primarily use watercolor, color pencil, and pen and ink to create my illustrations.  My art can be described as whimsical, touching the child within.  My childhood in the mountains was steeped in the cultural tradition of storytelling.  This tradition can be traced back to England, Ireland, &amp; Scotland etc.  The folklore &amp; grand ditties that we would share in my sub-culture down deep in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky, often inspired me to create delightful pictures in my imagination.   Now, years later, I am still continuing to express myself, through painting, drawing, writing and telling stories.  I received a higher education at the universities, pursued art and taught for a many years pressing through a lot of challenging moments.  My husband and I enjoy traveling and exploring many places and have moved a number of times through the military lifestyle.  At one time we lived in Germany, near the homestead of the Brothers Grimm.  Now we reside in beautiful, sunny Florida. Besides participating with my art at conventions and festivals, I am currently developing a children's book all about mermaids and projected to publish the end of 2019!  When you come by my exhibit you will see \"Mermaids From Around the World\", my ongoing \"Alice in Wonderland\" series, a series of Hobbit habitats as a tribute to the great J.R.R.Tolkein (author), and a little of \"The Realm of Wanderton\", a mystical fairy realm which is the theme of a NEW children's comic book projected to come by the end of 2020."

Since I was a wee girl back in the Appalachian Mountains,  I was steeped in the cultural tradition of storytelling, which can be traced back to England, Ireland, and Scotland.  The old folk tales, grand ditties, and riddles that we would share, often inspired me to create delightful pictures in my imagination.  I would take these images and sketch my own drawings and handmade books.  After high school, I received a higher education, pursued art and teaching for a long while.

Besides selling whimsical and fantasy art at conventions and art festivals, I am currently a few children's books.  "
