excerpt: "An exhibit of illustrations, graphics and fine arts I have created. As well as collector cards I create some of which are licensed by Lucasfilm, Nickelodeon, Netflix, and Topps. I will also do live painting/drawing to show my technique and process. "
description: "I am a professional fine artist, illustrator, and graphic designer. I have a BFA in Graphic Arts from Marshall University as well as a Masters of Arts in painting and illustration. I work as an independent artist and currently am licensed by Topps where I have had the pleasure of working on multiple cards sets including Star Wars, Stranger Things and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. My work is a mix of traditional subject matter with modern technology. I sell a mix of traditional watercolors, oils, and marker as well as computer-created prints. Most recently I have had work selected by Netflix to be featured in the upcoming Art of Stranger Things artbook that will be released October 15th."
