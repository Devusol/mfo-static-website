excerpt: "The Landspeeder is a bespoke power racing series car that will compete in the Orlando Power Racing Series event"
description: "Build from a discarded kids ride on toy the Landspeeder is a 48 volt power house of speed and fortified KPI and ackerman.  No expense was spared in this budget build. Only the best was used when it could be bartered from the jawas on Tatooine, we still think we got the short end of the stick on the tires. 

Watch for The Landspeeder on the race track this November!"
