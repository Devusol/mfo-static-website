  description: "I'm an artist, a faerie, a witchy woman, a stay at home mama.  I love wildflowers, thunderstorms, rainbows, sparkles.  I'm an avid reader, I play video games, and I love getting outside as much as possible with my kids.  
I love watercolors because of how unpredictable they are - I can have one thing in mind, but the paints might have something totally different!  And that's part of the magic for me - art has such a voice of its own, and I love seeing what my paintings have to show me both along the way, and once they are done.
