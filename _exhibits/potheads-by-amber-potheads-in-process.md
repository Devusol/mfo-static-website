excerpt: "A short glimpse into the long process of my Pothead making. "
description: "Potheads are whimsical hand sculpted little succulent planters.  I want to take this opportunity to show people how they are made. Not with the intention of recreating the subject, but as a way to satisfy curiosity and get excited about clay.  My idea is to set up a small ceramic studio where I will be working on my potheads.  I will show my different techniques for sculpting, my tools and the different phases of the pothead production.  I will have an area where I will work in wet clay, sculpting the potheads and area for painting potheads in the second and third phase.    A few finished Potheads will be on display.  Nothing will be for sale at this time."
