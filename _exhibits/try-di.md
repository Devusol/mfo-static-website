description-long: "Build a free standing bridge using limited materials (1 index card, 1 mailing label, 2 straws, &amp; 2 paper clips) that can span a gap of 6, 8 or 10 inches.  Bonus points for each spider your bridge can support.  Or create a bug using provided materials and tell us about it.  If we have enough space, we can bring KEVA planks as well (a fun building/creating activity that is also appropriate for very young children)."
