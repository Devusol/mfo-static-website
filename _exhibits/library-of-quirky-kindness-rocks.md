excerpt: "Unique and quirky painted rocks that are meant to bring joy, pass on to a friend as a random act as kindness or share with a loved one.  Find one that matches your personality!"
description: "My exhibit area is two parts.  It features an area where I display my Kindness Rocks and products I use to make them.  I share techniques on how to work with stone, what types of mediums work with a porous canvas and types of sealer.  I provide another area where families can \"Make N Take\" their own kindness rocks.  They can stop and paint a rock, using paint pens and markers."

  description: "I am Maker of all things Geek and quirky.  I paint on quarry stone using a wide variety of mediums: POSCA paint pens, Chameleon Alcohol Ink Blenders, and Derwent Inktense. Marrying these products together gives my work a unique folk art feel, so you see each item is handmade and not manufactured.  I am a longtime FIRST Robotics coach and LEGO enthusiast and member of the Greater Florida LEGO Users Group.  Stop by and meet and MAKE with me!"
