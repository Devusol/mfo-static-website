description: "Learn simple wire wrapping techniques using up cycled kiln fired wine bottle rings to make a pendant. Or Christmas Ornament. Come see our bottle wind chimes with fused glass clangers, fused glass candle holders and screens, framed mosaic glass pictures, dichroic pendants and other items we make. Be sure to check out our upcoming classes if you're interested in trying glass for yourself."
description-long: "We love to teach others about our passion, GLASS!! There are many ways to work with glass. Stained glass is created by running foil around pieces of glass and then soldering them together. Mosaics are tiny pieces of glass cut to form patterns and applied to a base. This can be done to window glass and framed to create beautiful pictures. Fusing is the process of kiln firing glass so that the pieces melt together to form the shape, which can then be slumped into a mold to shape it.
We love to teach structured classes at the Oviedo Mall and also offer private instruction to meet your requirements/schedule.
Come take a look at some of our pieces. Maybe you will get inspired to try glass for yourself."

  description: "We are a group of glass crafters who enjoy working together on projects in our studio. Stained glass, fused glass and mosaics are some of the basic techniques employed and we continue to expand our knowledge about the craft and enjoy sharing this with those interested in trying a new craft.  We believe in upcycling window and bottle glass that would end up in landfills, into beautiful art that can be used in everyday life."
