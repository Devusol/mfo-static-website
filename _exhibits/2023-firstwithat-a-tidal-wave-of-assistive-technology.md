  description: "Roaring Riptide’s dive into Assistive Technology began in June 2017, when students partnered with a UF Student Organization B.O.T.S. (Building Others Through Stem) to host their first toy adapt-a-thon event. At this event, 10 My Pal Scout toys were finished and delivered to an AT specialist in our surrounding community. In the months after, they were invited to attend their first ever Holiday Toy Adapt-A-Thon at the FACTUR workspace in Orlando, Florida. Along with B.O.T.S. and FIRST FRC Team #5816- GRA-V, Roaring Riptide students adapted over 100 toys for local children in North Central Florida for the holidays. RR has worked with multiple agencies and non-profit organizations to positively impact the lives of children with disabilities at the local, state, national, and international levels.
We’ve continued our work in AT through building industry partnerships and collaborating within our local school system. At the 2019 ATiA conference, we connected with the non-profit group, Magic Wheelchair. From this meeting, students of Roaring Riptide contacted Magic Wheelchair because they wanted to help one of the many children on the waitlist for these amazing wheelchair costumes! In 2019, we were paired with Zyler and Zaivion Mason. After months of design and creation, RR hosted a Magic Wheelchair reveal at Rawlings Elementary School, where they delivered two Paw Patrol themed costumes to the brothers on Halloween!Seeing the impact AT has had on our local community and beyond, RR aims to engage even more FIRST Robotics teams in AT through our #FIRSTwithAT movement. 
We also seek to work with individuals with different abilities, who have specific needs solutions and hope to provide some low-tech assistive technology equipment at our booth at Maker Faire Orlando."
