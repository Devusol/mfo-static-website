description-long: "The New Smyrna Maker Space is set to officially open in 2023. We are a non-profit and the only maker space of its kind in Volusia County.  We would like to be able to provide a great experience and value for makers in our community. 

Our goal for this convention is to network with other maker spaces and attract members and volunteers who want to help. We will have photos of our space and examples of the workshops we have had in the past.  Our exhibit would also showcase some projects our members have made."
