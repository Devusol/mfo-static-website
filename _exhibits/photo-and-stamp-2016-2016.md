description: "Each unique hand-crafted piece combines the artist's life-long love of photography and stamp collecting with her artistic appreciation for both everyday items and unusual objets d'art. Each unique piece ranges from matted 3-Dimensional photo cards to jewelry to functional artwork, such as coasters, wine rings, bookmarks, keychains and even birdhouses. Her artwork can be both  inspirational and whimsical, designed to instill respect, admiration and gratitude for all the beauty surrounding us. Laura explains, \"I feel grateful for the intelligence in the world that motivates me all the time. I'm forever in awe of the bountiful animals, flowers, and scenery that are so colorful and beautiful. They take my breath away, making me stop and think, 'Wow, look at that!' and then, I capture the image with my camera. I love all the amazing wonders on this planet that inspire me to live harmoniously with nature and peacefully with others.\""
