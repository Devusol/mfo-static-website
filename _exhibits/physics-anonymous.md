excerpt: "A collection of projects and exhibits created in the making of our science, machining, electronics, and generally-everything-goes YouTube channel"
description: "Over the course of the last three years we have been on an adventure to inspire others to make random, interesting and sometimes even useful things. During that journey we have build 3D printers, a Christmas tree made of lasers, high speed skateboards, propane powered pumpkins, taken ultra high resolution pictures of tiny insects, and even made Santa fly (with adorable kitten reindeer on the bridle). We are looking forward to bringing many of these projects, and maybe a special never before seen, made-just-for-Maker-Faire-Orlando project to share our stories, ideas, and enthusiasm for building things, creativity, and hands-on science."

    description: "We are a pair of YouTube creators interesting in all things maker. We create useful (and often times completely useless) creations. We tend to leap way before we look, and are always entertained by the result. My brother and I both have art backgrounds, but have been heavily influenced by engineering thanks to our rocket scientist father. "
