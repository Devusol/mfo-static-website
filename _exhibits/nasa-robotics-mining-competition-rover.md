excerpt: "We built a Mars rover to compete in the NASA Robotics Mining Competition"
description: "We will be demoing the robot that we have been working on for the past year for the NASA Robotics Mining Competition. The robot is designed to traverse and mine the same soil simulant that NASA and builders of real extraterrestrial rovers use to test their robots that actually go to space. The robot is designed to be the closest you can get to a fully functional Mars Rover without actually going to Mars. 

During the event we will be able to talk about the interesting design work that our club has put into the robot, demonstrating prototype components that we 3D printed out of advanced filaments, and talking about what iterations we plan to implement leading up to when we compete in May."
