  description: "Both Monica and myself work in creating original pieces of high-quality original art in a specialized fashion. Monica focuses on using color pencils/acrylic on color matte board to bring out the vibrant color theory in reverse for her detail portrait and hyperrealism. While I showcase how traditional comic style can be brought into a digital art medium. "
