description-long: "Merlin and Mim costumes are made from 100% cotton, feature reversible mix and match components, and are designed to incorporate adaptive features. All children should be able to experience the joy of playing dress up without a health condition limiting what they can wear. Alternate openings and access points are disguised in the seams, so all styles are the same, with or without adaptive modifications. "

  name: "Noni Mitchell"
  description: "Noni is a life-long crafter who is constantly learning and trying new things. She has a huge heart, always wanting to make life better for those around her. As a child she tried to rescue every stray she came across and as an adult did just that for many years. A love of fantasy and theater led her to Society for Creative Anachronism where she was able to play dress up and pretend whenever she wanted. Noniâ€™s research into historical clothing helped create many of the adaptive features in the Merlin and Mim costumes. "
