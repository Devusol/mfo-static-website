description: "Human Powered Snow Cones via a Rube Goldberg looking Hamster wheel"
description-long: "Be the Maker as you run in a human sized hamster wheel to create your own snow cone. It&#039;s all you. No outside power source needed. Crank the various handles to move your cup along a conveyor, toot the train whistle, run in the wheel, apply the flavoring via showerheads to complete the project, and then enjoy the fruits of your labor."
