excerpt: "We are Hagerty Robotics from Oviedo, Florida. We are a program that aims to spread STEM to our community through our three teams that compete in the various competition levels FIRST and VEX has to offer. Last year, our robot took us all the way to the FIRST World Championships where we had a blast competing and learning. We hope to share our robot and the FIRST motto to the next generation of young innovators at Maker Faire Orlando and we can't wait to see you there!"

We are a program that aims to spread STEM to our community through our three teams that compete in the various competition levels FIRST and VEX has to offer. Last year, with hard work and determination, our robot and engineering notebook took us all the way to the FIRST World Championships in Houston Texas.  At our exhibit, we will be demonstrating our robot(s) around the floor and showcasing our maneuverability, agility, and particle shooting abilities. Guests will have an opportunity to operate the robot and earn a special \"robot drivers license\"."
