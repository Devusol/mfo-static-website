excerpt: "Please see my adobe spark presentation for a detailed description of the project.

Essentially it would work like this:
1. Attendees finish their drinks and bring their cups to the Precious Plastic station/and or RecycleMobile(16ft trailer outfitted with all the machines we are currently building)
2. Attendee(under the supervision of Precious Plastic team member) drops the cup in the hopper of the Precious Plastic shredder, watches it shredded into tiny flakes
3. Attendee takes flakes(still under supervision) over to the injection molding machine and pours the flakes down into the tube. After about 2 minutes the plastic is hot enough to inject and the attendee pulls down on the lever to inject the plastic into the mold of their choice
4. The molten plastic cools down enough to be removed from the mold and the Attendee receives their one-of-a-kind work of art that they made from the cup they were just drinking out of
5. Attendee puts Maker Logo'd keychain on their keys to always be reminded of the eye-opening experience they had at the MakeFaire and the potential of using would be wasted material to create a new piece of art, on the spot.
