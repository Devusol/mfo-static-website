excerpt: "Geeky themed handcrafted home fragrance, all natural bath, beauty and spa products."
description: "All geeks need to be pampered after a hard day of video gaming and cosplay.  So we at Cherry Pit Crafts have developed an entire line of themed products sure to please the geek in everyone. Our products are handcrafted with only the best ingredients.  Themes include Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Disney, Arcade games and more! We carry soaps, bath salts, body lotion, lip balms, candles, incense, lip balms, etc..
One of our best sellers though are our cherry pit packs. Microwaveable cherry pit packs are filled with dried cherry stones that are reclaimed from a cannery located in Michigan. Cherry pits make a superior filler for natural heat pads because they are not subject to rancidity and pantry pests that can infest other fillers such as rice, corn, flax and barley. When heated in the microwave for two minutes they produce a moist relaxing heat that's perfect for relieving aches and pains.  These packs are reusable and last for many years.  They also conform to the natural contours of the users body in a way that ordinary heating pads just can't beat."
