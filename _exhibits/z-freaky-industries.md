excerpt: "Featuring presentations of CAN bus, IoT, Python applications, LED matrixes as wearables, electric skateboards, and advanced Arduino embedded systems."
description: "Hi! Ever found yourself intrigued about the smaller quirks of automotive J1939 CAN bus? Perhaps you've thought about integrating it in your next project with an Arduino? I'll be featuring projects utilizing it and share my tips and tricks with getting started on CAN bus.

Maybe you're more interested in Python application development with Internet of Things device integration? Worry not! I've got Python apps that process gifs for LED matrixes, and interpret alerts from your favorite streaming services! (Say hi to the audience)

Perhaps building an electric skateboard is an interest? Well, I've made a few of them and will share what to consider when getting started!

Or maybe you want to get started with Arduinos as small as a grain of rice? I will also be sharing my adventures in using the ATTINY10 and the magic of its low power capabilities!"
