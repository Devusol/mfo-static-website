description: "A Recumbent Bicycle and Capstan HEH will allow 10 Users to create 120vdc and light 56 or more bulbs."
description-long: "A recumbent Bicycle HEH will enable a single User to exercise arms and legs while making DC electricity, as evidenced by the illumination of 6 bulbs. A wattmeter will display the energy created digitally, in real time.
A Capstan HEH will enable up to 8 Users to illuminate seven test light stands for a total of 48 bulbs. The illumination is directly proportional to the number of Users and the sweat energy expended, so there is the potential for learning about Ohm&#039;s Law."
