    description: "Grant dove right into combat robotics Fall 2017 as an apprentice to Kurt Durjan with KurTrox.  He helped build Axe Backwards and competed on Season 3 and 4 of Battlebots. Grant enjoys the friends and competitors he's met at local combat robot battles.  He created a robotics club at his school to help other kids expand their STEM interests. "
