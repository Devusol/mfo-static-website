excerpt: "Steampunk and other adventurous wearables, constructed from a variety of reclaimed items mixed with new and vintage fabrics. My exhibit will also allow people to construct a plumed mini-top hat from their choice of a variety of fabrics, pre-cut to allow for completion in about an hour. "
description: "As a tailor and milliner, making hats and clothing for adventurous gentlemen and ladies I collect ....souvenirs....as I travel with my friend Mr. Verne, which I incorporate into my work. My last ensemble included an 18th century skirt, a Victorian corset, a leather coat from 1970, and something called a \"power suit\" from 1990, though I cannot imagine what power it may have wielded since it revealed nothing of the feminine wiles which I find so reliable. Look for 1940's aprons styled into modern skirts using 18th century design and construction methods; hats made from gelatin molds, and vintage jewelry-trimmed fabric totes. I am the costume designer for Opera Orlando's Steampunk \"Tales of Hoffman\" as well as dozens of productions from musical theatre to serious historic events.   I accept short term apprentices as introductory hat-makers."

I have costumed dozens of professional productions, from Opera Orlando's steampunk \"Tales of Hoffman\" to historic reenactments and Carnegie Hall concerts. As the TimeWarpTailor I travel with my friend, Mr. Verne, collecting....\"souvenir?\"...clothing pieces which I incorporate into my wardrobe; one recent ensemble combined an eighteenth century skirt, a 1970's leather trenchcoat, a Victorian corset and a 1990's 'power suit'."
