description: "I'm Daniella, and I'm a digital illustrator! I'm a big fan of bright colors, cartoons, and stories set in outer space.  

I'll be selling art prints, sketchcards, stickers, and buttons featuring my work, as well as taking commissions! I'll be working on sketchcards during the event, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about digital art!"
