    description: "I'm a self taught artist, who like to experiment different art styles and mediums. I'm very much obsessed with fluid styles of art. I like everything about nature, beaches and all that glitters. My inspiration for art comes from nature photography, our travels and google earth.
I have been making art for last 8 year and got a chance to experiment many art mediums. I would like get my hands on encaustic art sometime soon in the future. "
