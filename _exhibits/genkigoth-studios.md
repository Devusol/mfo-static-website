excerpt: "GenkiGoth Studios is comprised of Miriam and Dee Jay, two Florida based artists whose combined backgrounds in classical, urban, and multi-media art embrace their love of nerd culture through their loosely narrative, but mostly spontaneous paintings."
description: "Stencil and/or acrylic painted canvas, both original and fanart specializing in general pop culture (comics, anime, gaming, etc). While the majority of our work is approached in spray paint, we can make a selection of stencils specifically for the general audience, where the image can be made through stippling rather than spray paint."
