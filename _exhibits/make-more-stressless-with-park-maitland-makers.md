excerpt: "Come and enjoy making your own “MAKE MORE Stress-less” dexterity ball with the 4th grade student makers. Learn about how to use low cost/free materials  to make a tool that can help guide creative 21st Century Thinking as well as exercise your hand and mind at the same time.  This will be a free “make and take” but we would encourage you to discover the ways that Park Maitland Makers give back to our surrounding community with our amazing Ambassador programs."
description: "Come and enjoy making your own “MAKE MORE Stress-less”dexterity ball with the 4th grade student makers.  Learn about how stress balls absolutely work, and there’s science to back it up. When we get stressed out, our brain has two channels. A sensory channel (sight, sound, feel, and smell) and an intellectual channel that tries to makes sense of how we feel and put it into context.
When your sensory channel is blocked or occupied, your experiences aren’t as intense or vivid. In other words, when you’re physically occupied with something (squeezing the stress ball) your mind isn’t focused or concentrated on whatever is stressing you out. This is why some of the best stress reducers are physical activities. Let’s create one of these together. We will share our designed and tested process so you too can make these at home."

In their newly renovated Maker Space, students hone their 21st Century Skills of collaboration, problem solving, creativity, and critical thinking through project based learning. Students are encouraged to tinker and are taught the design process through different modes and hands-on learning experiences. Science, technology, engineering, the arts, and math all play a role in their learning! Students further share their learning to authentic audiences through showcases, hands-on exhibits, and by creating learning experiences for others."
