  description: "Matthew Sutton is a licensed professional illustrator and comic artist! He has created over 3,000 official pieces of licensed artwork for properties such as: Star Wars, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Rick & Morty, and many more! 

Matthew enjoys helping people especially kids learn the basics of drawing in order to demystify the process and empower young artists to feel confident that they too can learn the skills of drawing.

I&#039;ve had the pleasure of exhibiting with Maker Faire for the past few years and I&#039;m very much looking forward to it again this year if I&#039;m allowed. Thanks so much for your time! "
