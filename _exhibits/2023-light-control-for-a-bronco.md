description: "How I control my aux lights in my Ford Bronco."
description-long: "My progress of just using switches to turn on lights. To using microcontrollers, relays, and Rf to turn them on. When I first began I just used 3 switches in a project box.
Then I upgraded to making a Adafruit Macropad like setup using 2 microcontrollers, 2 neokeys, relay board, rf transmiter, rotary encoder, and oled display. 
Then I upgraded again and brought an actual Adafruit Macropad and used a seesaw board to control a bigger relay board.
And now I am working on making the whole thing wireless and using a rf relay boards.
Since I am changing out my setup right now. I thought why not put my old setups on a poster board and show it off at Maker faire. "
