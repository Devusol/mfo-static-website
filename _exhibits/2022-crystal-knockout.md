description-long: "Crystal Knockout specializes in small-batch, handmade, vegan nail polish in a variety of colors and finishes. One of our most popular creations is thermochromic nail polish that changes colors with temperature! We&#039;ve also begun making magnetic nail polish that can be manipulated with a neodymium magnet to create ripples and stripes. In addition to nail polish, we offer a selection of jewelry and resin creations that are created with the same pigments and glitters we use in our polish, as well as some hand and nail care items."

  description: "Candace was born-and-raised in Orlando and is a graduate of William R. Boone High School and the University of Central Florida. She&#039;s a trained vocalist, an amateur computer techie, a caffeine addict, a kitty wrangler, and happily married to a fellow Orlando native. She began her career in creativity in 2013 when she opened a small business making crystallized goods, including cell phone cases, wedding cake toppers, and apparel. Soon after, her love of color drew her to start dabbling in nail polish and other cosmetics and Crystal Knockout was born."
