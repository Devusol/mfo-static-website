excerpt: "Yard Art &gt;&gt;&gt; Ronnie the Quadropuss / Marty the Mahi / Walter the Pelican"
description: "These guys are yard art made from mild steel. A design was drawn in Fusion360. That was loaded into the laser and cut from 1/4\" MDF and plywood to be used as templates for each part. The templates were clamped onto sheets of mild steel. A plasma cutter was used to cut the sheet metal. A couple hours with a grinder and they were ready for steel rods to be MIG welded on so that each piece can be inserted into the ground and stand on their own. I plan on promoting a moderate amount of surface rust before neutralizing it and painting with clear coat for long term protection against further weathering."
