  description: "Orlando Science Center is Central Florida’s award-winning, hands-on science museum. For more than 60 years, our exhibits and programming have brought science to life for not just residents of Central Florida, but also visitors from around the world. 

The Orlando Science Center is home to The Hive: A Makerspace. Come see what all the buzz is about! In The Hive, the possibilities are as vast as your imagination. Learn how to sew a button, fold an origami crane, design a figurine using 3D modeling software then bring it to life with a 3D printer, or solder a circuit board – there’s always something new to try! 

Many of the best designs come from collaboration. The Hive is a space that cultivates community and emphasizes the learning opportunities in every failure and success. Being a maker is all about creativity and experimentation.

With four floors of interactive exhibit halls, labs and workshops, theaters, an observatory, and experiences that change with the seasons, there is always something exciting for our 670,000 annual visitors to see and do at Orlando Science Center. "
