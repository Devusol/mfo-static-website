description: "Mondo Bizarro is a 3-pound beetleweight drum spinner."
description-long: "Mondo Bizarro's drum is powered by a brushless outrunner motor that is built into the drum. The drum is reversible so if the robot is flipped upside down, the drum can spin in the opposite direction and still run effectively. Mondo Bizarro has achieved wide success over the years, including winning the 2013 Motorama and March 2019 Norwalk Havoc events and winning the bronze medal at the 2023 Robogames. "
