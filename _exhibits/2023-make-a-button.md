  description: "As an FRC team, Wingspan participates in a nine week build season each year where the team builds a robot that completes specific tasks. As a team, we pride ourselves on being a student-led team; with our mentors as guides, team members design, program, and build the robots we compete with while discovering new solutions, innovating on previous solutions, impacting the world around us, working as a team, finding ways to include everyone’s skills, and having fun! But building robots isn’t all we do! Wingspan actively goes out into our community to share our passion for STEM. We strive to make sure everyone of all ages and backgrounds feels comfortable entering a STEM-focused space to prepare them with the tools they need to change the world."
