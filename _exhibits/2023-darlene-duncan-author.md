  description: "Darlene Duncan grew up wanting to be a published author. From the time she was old enough to read and write, her goal was to publish her stories. The dream of being a published author was delayed by the everyday necessities of life. Things like working so she could have a roof over her head and food. This energy and time drain delayed the dream, though the stories were always there percolating and occasionally bubbling to the surface.

Her favorite books are science fiction and mysteries. So, it was no surprise that her first published novel, The Origin of Deanna Dorak, was a combination of those two elements. 

Her most recent publications are the first three books in The Larissa Carpenter Mystery series; A New Beginning in Coventry Beach, Lust & Distrust, and Fatal Misunderstanding. The first two of the series are already available on Audible. Her other recent release is a Dystopian future, action-adventure book titled The Legend of Erin Foster. All her books are available as Kindle books.

Currently, she's working on book four of The Larissa Carpenter Mystery series. The working title is Case Closed.
