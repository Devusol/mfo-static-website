description: "Celebrating Three Years at Maker Faire Orlando, I'll have a large selection of Halloween home decor, original illustrations, and a selection fan art inspired pieces that you can display throughout your home or office, or given as a one-of-a-kind gift. I'll be at my booth throughout the weekend showing how to prep surfaces, ink, and paint on wood, as well as having a variety of coloring sheets for attendees to color and take home with them!"
