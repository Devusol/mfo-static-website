description-long: "Kids of all ages place a cup on a conveyor, advance the cup via a hand crank, sound a train horn, elevate the cup via a hand crank, add ice to the grinder, and then start running to grind up their ice to create their own snow cone. Once the cup is over filled with shaved ice, they advance their cup further down the conveyor to smash the ice it the cup via an over-sized sledge hammer, and then on to the flavor choices which are applied via shower heads. No electricity needed. Everything is achieved via their own power.  The machine was built to get kids interested in the STEM program."
