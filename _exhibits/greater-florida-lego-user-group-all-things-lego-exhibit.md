    description: "The Greater Florida LEGO® Users Group (GFLUG) was formed in summer of 2000 for the sole purpose of giving Adult Fans of LEGO® (AFoL) a way to express their unique hobby. Over the years we have displayed at numerous model railroad shows, art festivals, Disney conventions and sci-fi conventions as a group. GFLUG does not favor one form of the hobby over any other, giving its membership a wide range of exposure.

The primary goal of the group is camaraderie that is achieved by providing members the opportunity to meet other adults who share a common fascination with the LEGO® hobby through correspondence, meetings and events. We are a family oriented group with member's spouses and children helping at select events and enjoying the fruits of our building labor."
