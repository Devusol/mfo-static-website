  description: "ChipScapes are pictures taken of computer chips, sort of microscopic chip landscapes, or ChipScapes for short. The artwork is created by photographing a silicon computer chip using a microscope and special lighting. Silicon is a silvery gray element and not very exciting to look at. The colors in ChipScapes come from a process I use that creates a prism effect derived from special lighting that takes advantage of the layered manufacturing process of computer chips. I use different lighting, angles, and the prism effect of chips to create colorful images of an otherwise boring gray chip. I use mostly vintage microprocessors and memory chips from the 1970s and 1980s. In addition to the artwork and the chip, I also include stories about the history and importance of the chips. I use shadow box frames, canvas, and jewelry frames. My artworks are in museums around the world. I bring a table, display grids, and a microscope."
