  description: "I'm a first time builder in the realm of combat robots. I have been a huge fan of combat robot for many years and didn't actually believe that i could do it until seeing 3lb bots at MakerFaire in 2018. I am excited for the chance to check (and continue to check) that of my bucket list."
