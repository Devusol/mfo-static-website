excerpt: "We are father &amp; sons 3d business offering full range of 3d services. Last year we did 3 new designs modeled, printed &amp; videos up every week &amp; ended up with over 200 by years end. This year we are focusing on getting our website up &amp; working on architectural renderings &amp; models too. We look forward to making new connections &amp; meeting new makers everyday. So stoked to be part of this makers faire as this was the biggest &amp; best maker show we have done to date."
description: "This will be our 2nd time at Orlando Makers Faire &amp; we are so stoked to be back. We are doing a lot more architectural modeling along with prototyping &amp; props. We never try to make copies of original designs but do our version of them, its our homage to all things we love. We design stuff I loved as a kid &amp; stuff my kids love. Make sure you check us out on YouTube as we have over 400 videos up atm &amp; we now do a weekly livestream Sundays Skewed Stream w/ Sholm &amp; Sons every Sunday at 9pm est., please make sure you subscribe &amp; ring bell as we always got new content coming out. Thanks for taking time to read description &amp; look forward to meeting everyone there. Make sure you swing by our tables &amp; say hi, we will also be bringing a lot of little 3d printed goodies for handouts too. Have a wonderful day. God bless"
