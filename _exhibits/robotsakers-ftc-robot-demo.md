description-long: "RobotSakers started during the 2018-2019 season of the FIRST Tech Challenge and developed a robot to compete in the year's game, Rover Ruckus. After experiencing our first season and learning the ropes of robotics, our dedication to spreading STEM skyrocketed and we want to extend our mission to Maker Faire by demoing our robot. Our exhibit will showcase our bot, how we built it, and how you can get involved in FIRST."
