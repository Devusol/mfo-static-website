description: "Custom designed robots, a drawing machine from a 3D-printer and shiny lights with fancy effects!"
description-long: "I make things in a tiny workshop tucked away in my bedroom closet. A single workbench and some basic tools are used to build robots, make art and videos, and all sorts of fun lights!

I will have on display two different versions of my two-wheeled robot. I recently improved the design and will have a functioning version with hub-less wheels rolling around.

The exhibit will also feature an interactive plotter typewriter. The words typed on   a keyboard will be written by a pen plotter in (near) real time.

My various tube light fixtures will also be there, shining away and making pretty colors! "
