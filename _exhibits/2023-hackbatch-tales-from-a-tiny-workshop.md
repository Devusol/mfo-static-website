description: "Custom designed robots, a drawing machine from a 3D-printer and shiny lights with fancy effects!"
description-long: "I make things in a tiny workshop tucked away in my bedroom closet. A single workbench and some basic tools are used to build robots, make art and videos, and all sorts of fun lights!

I will have on display two different versions of my two-wheeled robot in various stages of completion. I recently improved the design and will have a functioning hub-less wheel to demonstrate.

The exhibit will also feature a 3D printer acting as a pen plotter. Visitors can pick up a post card drawn by a robot!

My various tube light fixtures will also be there, shining away and making pretty colors! "
