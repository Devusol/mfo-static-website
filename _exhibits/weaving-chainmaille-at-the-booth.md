description: "Pop by the Steampunk Garage booth to catch a glimpse of chainmaille being constructed - one painstaking ring at a time!  Feel free to grill the maker on any chainmaille-related trivia while you're there.  Jenifer has been weaving maille for over 15 years and has many offbeat and one-of-a-kind pieces of chainmaille unlike anything you've ever seen before.  She has an extensive knowledge base of the maille you've seen around the world: in museums, hotels, the movies, even in space!"
