  description: "I&#039;ve been building anything and everything for over 10 years. My passion for design and building things led me to get a degree in mechanical engineering from USF. I&#039;ve never built a robot before this one but I think they&#039;re awesome and I hope to start building more. Check out my YouTube channel \"Stuff I Build\" to see videos of my robot and other projects!"
