excerpt: "Let us show you how SCORE can help you start your new business or grow your existing business...FREE!"
description: "We are SCORE, a volunteer non-profit organization.  SCORE was founded as the Service Corps of Retired Executives.  We are now known just by the acronym SCORE.
SCORE’s mission is to counsel new business owners, businesses who are ready to grow and businesses who are floundering and need help righting the ship.  We also offer a series of seminars on how to run a business to help train new business owners and those who are still in the start-up phase.  SCORE is one of the best kept secrets in town…and the best part is our counseling is FREE!  We do charge a nominal fee for our seminars.  Our offices are located at the NEC center in Fashion Square on East Colonial.
Our goal for having a booth at the Maker Faire is to create more awareness about SCORE in the general public in the Orlando area."
