description: "Tampa Deep Sea Xplorers LLC (TDSX) is a manufacturer of Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV). "
description-long: "TDSX&#039;s flagship product is named the Barracuda, which is a small man-portable autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which can easily reach depths up to 500 meters. At 16 Kg (35 lbs), the Barracuda is light enough to be hand launched from a small vessel or from the shoreline. Although the vehicle has a small footprint, it is strong enough to withstand the pressures encountered at depth. The Barracuda was designed to allow the rapid collection of sub-sea data to support researchers, explorers, and individuals, as well as the objectives of the GEBCO Seabed 2030 Initiative."
