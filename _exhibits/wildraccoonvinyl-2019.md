excerpt: "We will have vinyl decals and stickers. We have a bunch of ready made decals AND we are of course bringing our Klic N Kut so you can pick a design and watch how a decal is cut. We love a challenge so custom designs are very welcome! 
"
description: "We will have available many different decals already made. We have 24 different colors. Originally we started with anything that we are fans of; from Pokemon to Quotes and Monograms. We figured the best way to get to know our new Klic N Kut machine is to cut everything. 

Now that we know how the machine works, we would like to show others what it can do. We will be providing the opportunity to request custom decals. We would be happy to explain how the machine cuts and show you how to create a design.

Our daughter's Girl Scout Troop #999 will also be stopping by with some awesome crafts to fund raise for the troop. 

(Psst! If you are the cute little girl that gave us that Harry Potter crest challenge, we have not forgotten about you, but the craziness of last year, your address got lost. Hope to see you this year!)"
