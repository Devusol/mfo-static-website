# Maker Faire Orlando Can’t Happen Without Makers!
We need people willing to share the things they create and their passion for making. Join us and help inspire thousands in our community.

There is no fee for individuals or community groups to exhibit at Maker Faire Orlando. There is a seller fee for individuals, small companies and startups to sell products you make at the event. Established companies and those looking to advertise are encouraged to [sponsor Maker Faire Orlando](/become-a-sponsor) which includes significant sponsor benefits.

## Application Deadline: September 1st, 2021

&nbsp;

### [Click Here to Apply](https://www.jotform.com/makereffect/cfm2021)

&nbsp;

**COMBAT ROBOT COMPETITORS: You will be emailed a special form just for Combat Robots after you register on buildersdb and are accepted into the competition - you do not need to complete this form.**

Exhibits are not approved in the order received, and it will be several weeks before we start the application process. We will contact you via the email provided in the exhibit application if we need more information or when your application has been approved or rejected. We are an all-volunteer team and we appreciate your patience as we process hundreds of applications.

Unfortunately, we do not have space at the event for all exhibit applications. Please ensure that you highlight your exhibit with good photos / video / description when you submit. We also maintain a balance between selling / non-selling exhibits and a good mix of the type of exhibits.

### Getting started when our Call For Makers is open:

Step 1: Register for the Maker Faire Orlando Website. If you created an account to exhibit in a prior year, you do not need to create a new account, just login (and you can reset your password if needed).

Step 2: Create a Maker Profile on the Maker Dashboard on the My Account menu. Note: this page is only available once you’ve registered, verified, and logged in.

Step 3: Create an Exhibit Proposal attached to your Maker Profile. We will notify you about your proposal status as we do our rounds of approvals. The status of your exhibit proposals is visible on the Maker Dashboard. Please note that exhibits are approved by a curation process in several rounds, and are not approved based on submission date order.

Maker Faire Orlando is a curated event. We reserve the right to select exhibits based on proposal completeness, exhibit content, content diversity, items sold, and other factors.
