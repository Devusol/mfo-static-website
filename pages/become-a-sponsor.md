# We need your help to educate & inspire!


With non-profits and the maker community still recovering from the pandemic, financial and in-kind support from our sponsors is more important then ever.

If you'd like to help support STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Math) education in Central Florida, please consider sponsoring the programs of The Maker Effect Foundation. We are happy to match an existing program with your organization's goals, or to create a new program tailored to meet your community objectives.
