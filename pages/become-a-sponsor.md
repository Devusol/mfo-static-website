# We need your help to educate & inspire!


While a large Maker Faire Orlando event will not be held in 2020, we are still working every day to improve our communities through maker skills education and supporting those who learn, make and share with others.

 If you'd like to help support STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts & Math) education in Central Florida, please consider sponsoring the programs of The Maker Effect Foundation. We are happy to match an existing program with your organization's goals, or to create a new program tailored to meet your community objectives.



For more information, please contact us at <sponsor@makerfaireorlando.com>  for more information.

Sponsorship of Maker Faire Orlando benefits The Maker Effect Foundation, a 501(c)(3) entity. Proceeds fund maker programs in local schools, community groups, and makerspaces, as well as our international maker research efforts.
