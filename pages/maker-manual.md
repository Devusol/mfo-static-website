# Maker Manual

THANK YOU for exhibiting at Maker Faire Orlando! This "Maker Manual" covers many of the common questions about exhibiting at the event, and helps us all stay organized as we move hundreds of exhibits in and out of the event space!


These details should not change, however we recommend checking this page in the days leading up to the event for any small changes to timing or load-in details that may arise one our team is setting up the event on-site.


**If you have a question that isnâ€™t addressed below, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com> (or for Combat Robot competitors, email the Robot Ruckus crew at <contact@robotruckus.org>)** Please include your exhibit or team name in the email as it helps us quickly locate your exhibit.


## Exhibit Spaces
* Our standard exhibit space is approximately at 10'x10' space. In some locations, the building structure against walls may protrude into the space.
* By default we provide one 8' table and two folding chairs per exhibit. You are welcome to bring your own tables / chairs so you have the exact configuration you need. If you require multiple tables / more chairs for a hands-on exhibit, etc., please email us (with your exhibit name) at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>.
* We provide power to all interior spaces however it may not be located within your space. We strongly recommend bringing a 25' extension cord and a power strip to ensure you have what you need where you need it.
* Wi-Fi credentials are provided to selling exhibitors by the area captain, however the Wi-Fi at the Fairgrounds can be challenging. We recommend bringing a cellular device / hotspot as a backup.
* Pop-up tents (no larger than 10'x10') are welcomed outdoors, but must be weighted to avoid wind damage. Pop-up tents may not be used inside unless the top canopy is removed, per fire code.


## Load-in & Load-out
### Load-in Times
* General load-in is on Friday from 10AM to 8PM (completed by 8PM please, not arriving at 8PM).
* Saturday load-in is from 8AM to 9AM. Makers arriving after 8:30AM will need to park in general parking and bring their items in. Makers arriving late adds a lot of stress for the maker and for our crew. Please arrive before 8:30AM if you need to unload as the parking area becomes quite congested after this point.
* On Sunday, exhibitors can arrive at 9AM, park in general parking and all exhibits should be ready for opening at 9:45AM.

**We STRONGLY advise Friday setup.** If something is wrong, we can likely fix it on Friday. If you donâ€™t arrive until Saturday morning, we have very limited ability to fix any issues. Friday night is also a GREAT time to meet other makers and to connect with your neighboring makers before the crowd arrives at the Maker Mixer (see below)!

If these times do not work for you and you need special arrangements, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>

### Load-In Unloading & Parking
* On Friday (All day) or Saturday (BEFORE 8:30AM), please park in general parking (the field across from the ticket area), walk over to the ticket booth area where we will have general Maker check-in and Robot Ruckus competitor check-in tents. Get your credentials and packet, THEN go get your vehicle to unload at your building. Unload, leave someone with your items, return your car to the parking lot, then go setup. We have 200+ exhibits to setup in a short period of time, and vehicles blocking lanes and loading and unloading zones slows everyone down. Please ensure you have a cart and sufficient helpers to help you with this process.

### Check in, Event Badges & Wristbands
You will receive a packet at the Maker Check-in Area which will be near the ticket booth area until Saturday morning at 9AM. Your packet will contain badges and wristbands for you and your helpers. (All requests for additional helpers (more than 4 total badges) should be sent to <makers@makerfaireorlando.com> with the exhibit name. All requests for additional helpers must be received by Sunday, November 6th). You are responsible for making arrangements to get credentials to your helpers. If you have a large group that will arrive at various times and you need our team to distribute the credentials, please email us at <makers@makerfaireorlando.com> with your exhibit name ASAP to make plans.

### Maker Mixer â€“ Friday night
The Maker Mixer is from 6PM to 7PM on Friday night. This is a great time to meet other makers, grab food (we will have some light food, but note that we will not be able to meet all dietary needs, please plan accordingly), and try some of the hands-on activities. Our goal is to have our Make-a-shirt and Make-a-button workshops open on Friday evening for the Maker Mixer so that Makers and Maker Helpers are able to make their own Maker Faire Orlando or Robot Ruckus shirt for only $10. We may have other hands-on activities open if those teams are on site Friday night and setup. Stay tuned for more info ðŸ™‚ Please note the Maker Mixer is limited to those with event (Maker / volunteer / etc.) credentials, no guests are allowed.

### Load-out
Load-out MAY NOT start until AFTER the event ends. Packing or leaving early without prior discussion and agreement may lead to your exhibit not being approved in subsequent years. All exhibits are 2 day exhibits unless youâ€™ve reached specific agreement with the event producers through the exhibit application process or by emailing <makers@makerfaireorlando.com>. Vehicles may not be moved into loading / unloading zones until after the event has ended and the crowd has left the building. The main roadway in front of the Spirit, Curiosity, and Opportunity buildings will not open until at least 1 hour after the event has closed for safety. We know you want to get home after a long weekend, but we ask for your patience as we safely exit the crowd.

## Maker Parking
Maker parking for the weekend will be on-site with the general parking. You may NOT park near your exhibit building. All parking for Maker Faire Orlando is FREE.

## General tips
* Bring a cart! We DO NOT have carts available.
* Label your stuff! A roll of masking tape and a sharpie are very useful.
* Bring more extension cords (a 25ft minimum) and power strips than you think you need.
* Please be patient with us. Maker Faire Orlando is a non-profit event produced by a great bunch of volunteers. Issues will happen, and we will get them resolved, but we need your patience especially during setup and Saturday morning ðŸ™‚
