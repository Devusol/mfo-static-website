# Power Racing - Live at Maker Faire Orlando!


Power Racing is an fun-filled racing experience where makers construct their own machines to go racing.Â  Racers can spend up to $500 on a racer that looks like a children's ride on toy!

## The Power Racing Series is returning in 2020! Â Do you have what it takes to build the best racer?

We are looking for some slightly crazy people with just enough engineering talent to be dangerous. Individuals and teams (friends, businesses, organizations) are welcome to join in the fun and to compete for Power Racing bragging rights!

You'll take a Power Wheels vehicle (craigslist has the best deals...), and modify it with a big electric motor, then pilot it around the track for glory! The latest rules allow for fully custom vehicles, as long as they appear to have been designed for kids, or could have been a ride-on toy ðŸ™‚

You can keep it simple, or go crazy...
